	abstract = {Online distance learning policies were formulated and implemented among some Malaysian universities long ago, but their value emerged since COVID-19. Emanating from the diffusion of innovation theory, this study examined the perception of higher education students on the influence and relationship between six independent variables (compatibility, observability, relative advantage, complexity, trialability, and digital skills) and one dependent variable (digital literacy). A total of 524 respondents were sampled, comprising students from six public and private Malaysian universities. The findings from the correlation analysis show a significant positive relationship between the six independent variables and the dependent variable. Meanwhile, in the regression analysis, three of the independent variables (observability, trialability, and digital skill) have a significant and positive effect on digital literacy. This study placed the diffusion of innovation in a specific context that supports designing online distance learning and digital literacy policies. © 2024 Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study aims to develop effective strategies for enhancing the digital skills of students specialising in information technology (IT). The study’s relevance is justified by the necessity to adjust educational methods to the dynamic development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital technologies in general. The object of the study is students at Astana IT University who are studying IT. The experimental group (EG) trains using IoT-integrated digital educational materials (DEMs), while the control group (CG) receives traditional training. Since existing research often omits the synergy between IoT and educational methods, creating a gap in understanding the effectiveness of integrated educational resources, this study applies research methodology, including literature analysis, experimentation, and statistical data analysis. The research results are verified using statistical methods such as the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and F-test. Analysing the mean scores in the experimental and CGs helps measure students’ progress in developing digital skills. The study aims to determine the effectiveness of IoT-integrated DEMs in enhancing students’ digital skills and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of these educational approaches on IoT learning. The findings will significantly improve educational programs and methodologies in the IT domain in line with current technological advancements. © 2024 by the authors of this article.},

	abstract = {The current study examines the relationship between digital competencies and collaboration attitudes among higher education students. To do so, data from 1316 students from 10 Spanish universities were analyzed and collected through a questionnaire named “Basic Digital Skills 2.0 of University Students” (COBADI®—Registered Trademark: 2970648). To provide context for the sample involved in this study, it is noteworthy that 50.5% of participants typically prefer to access the internet from home. Furthermore, it was observed that most of the respondents engage with the internet for over nine hours daily. The analysis of the results was conducted by calculating correlations between digital competencies and students’ collaboration attitudes. These correlations were computed using the Python programming language, with the libraries employed being pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Students who perceive themselves as more competent in using digital tools tend to have a slightly higher disposition to collaborate with their professors in virtual environments. Some competencies are more closely associated with collaboration than others, with those that exhibit a stronger connection being key focus areas in teaching and curriculum development. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The article presents the results of qualitative research investigating lower secondary school leavers’ self-regulated learning in the context of digital literacy. If we perceive digital literacy as a prerequisite for technology-enhanced learning, it is necessary to shed light on how pupils learn to use the technology and whether this method of learning is effective. The aim of the research is to clarify the principle of self-regulated learning to use computer software through problem-solving. Observations of pupils using Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Writer word processors were qualitatively analyzed using the grounded theory method. A model of self-regulated learning to use software was developed from the analysis. Most of the strategies used to solve problems involve choosing the optimal function integrated in the software and using it appropriately. The strategies a pupil uses are determined by their previous knowledge and experience of similar situations. A pupil’s metacognitive control mechanisms oversee the effectivity of their chosen strategies. The results achieved by a pupil may lead to learning that will enhance a pupil’s knowledge and skills, thereby influencing how they solve similar problems in the future. This model implies that pupils are able to independently master unfamiliar software and possibly similar technologies. The developed theory can serve as a basis for understanding the relationship between self-regulated learning and technological proficiency. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

In addition, the study examined the correlation between “daily Internet use,” “initial Internet usage,” and “purpose of Internet use” with the variables of DL, IA, and CL. The study groups consisted of 1220 higher education students including all faculties and all grades of a state university. The “Digital Literacy Scale,” “Internet Addiction Scale,” and “Cyberloafing Scale” were used as data collection instruments. The study’s findings revealed initial Internet usage to be a predictor of DL, IA, and CL. Similarly, participants who spent more than 6 h using the Internet during a day have a higher level of DL, CL, and IA. Results from structural equation modeling reported a positive association between DL and IA, a negative association between DL and CL, and a positive relationship between IA and CL. Moreover, an indirect effect was revealed from DL to CL through IA. The study suggests improving students’ DL skills, as they form the basis of avoiding CL behavior, and using the Internet mostly for educational purposes. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Amidst the rapid advancement of digital technology, proficiency in Logical Thinking Skills and Digital Literacy stands pivotal for adapting to societal shifts, with Self-Learning Capability being fundamental for knowledge updating and skill acquisition to ensure success; however, despite their paramount significance for accounting students' success, research probing the intricate interplay among these three facets remains notably limited. Thus, this study examined the intricate interplay among Logical Thinking Skills, Digital Literacy, and Self-Learning Capability in shaping the effectiveness of accounting internships for Generation Z students in Thailand. Using a quantitative research design with online surveys, this study engaged 559 respondents (90.7 % females and 9.3 % males). Analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the study found that Logical Thinking Skills and Digital Literacy significantly influence internship performance. When complemented by Self-Learning Capability, it's observed that students with high competency in these areas can better apply their skills in real-world professional settings and demonstrate continuous learning. They actively incorporate online information and media into their learning and self-development, further enhancing their skill set and career proficiency. This study underscores the importance of accounting education in Thai educational institutions offering accounting programs. It emphasizes that these skills should be integrated into the curriculum, especially in the digital age, to equip students to adapt effectively to the evolving demands of the accounting profession. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Integrated learning has been pushed into the mainstream of education with the help of digital technology. Today's digital tools make it easier for teachers and students to access learning resources flexibly. One needs to have a certain level of digital literacy to use technology effectively in learning. Digital literacy for learning is knowing how to operate technology and having the right information management to build skills or psychomotor abilities based on experience and practice gained from interacting with the environment critically. The analysis of the needs of students of the Department of Biology at the State Islamic University of Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang shows that students' digital literacy level is still relatively low. Learning resources in the form of certain electronic encyclopedias are still not used. Using valid electronic learning resources and appropriate learning models can improve digital literacy. So, this study aims to describe the validity and determine the effect of electronic encyclopedias on students' digital literacy in ethnobotany courses. This study uses a research design of One Group Pretest-Posttest Design on 17 students. The validity of the electronic encyclopedia was analysed using the validation sheet instrument of material experts, teaching materials experts, and field practitioners. The effectiveness of the electronic encyclopedia was analysed using SPSS on the N-Gain Score and Paired Sample T-Test with a significance level of 5%. The results showed that the material expert's assessment was 93.8% (very valid), the media expert's assessment was 99% (very valid), and the practitioner's expert assessment was 96.9% (very valid). In the results of the SPSS analysis, the value of g > 0.7 and the value of p = 0.000 < a (0.05). So, the PjBL-based ethnobotanical electronic encyclopedia is valid to be used as a learning resource and effectively improves students' digital literacy. The electronic encyclopedia of ethnobotany can also be used for further research, such as measuring other 21st- century skills. © 2024 Author(s).},

However, our current understanding of these skills' interconnection and development within technical and vocational higher education remains limited. This study aims to achieve two main objectives. First, we want to examine the level of digital skills among technical and vocational higher education students in Chile and how it relates to their socioeconomic background. Second, we aim to investigate how students' different levels of digital skills influence their satisfaction with online collaboration and their assessment of group processes after completing an online CPS task. The study identified three distinct groups of students based on their digital skills: high-skilled, medium-skilled, and low-skilled. The low-skilled group faced more socioeconomic disadvantages compared to the other two groups. Moreover, students with low digital skills reported lower satisfaction with online group work and a poorer self-evaluation of the group processes involved in the collaborative online task. Insights for technical and vocational higher education institutions to foster targeted support of digital skills development for their student body are discussed. © 2024},

	abstract = {This paper explored the level of Digital Literacy (DL) skills for learning among students in two selected public universities in Tanzania. Case study design was used to compare University of Dar es Salaam-UDSM and Sokoine University of Agriculture-SUA as two cases purposively selected. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select a total of 646 students where 325 students were from UDSM and 321 from SUA. The collected data were analysed using a combination of qualitative and descriptive approaches. The findings show that, students in the selected universities have some deficiencies in digital literacy skills for learning. Further, a slight variation exists between students of different programmes, indicating that, all students are predisposed to similar conditions for DL skills acquisition. Gender-wise, the paper indicates a closing gender gap in terms of technology acceptance and DL skills between male and female students. Furthermore, students in lower classes manifested higher skills compared to majority in higher classes on certain DL dimensions, suggesting that, one’s advancement to higher academic year does not necessarily translate into increased DL skills. This article recommends the need for a systemic and coordinated support to promote skills that enable students’ learning with ICT tools and internet. © 2024 The Author(s).

The survey took place in Taiwan with preservice preschool teachers who willingly completed a questionnaire. Initially, there were 416 data samples for further statistical analysis. This study utilizes literature reviews and theoretical reflections to examine the observed variables and factors in the “Service Learning and Critical Digital Literacy Scales” (SLCDL) questionnaire. To assess these aspects, a Chinese questionnaire is used, covering “service learning”, “critical digital literacy”, and “online social capital”. Using partial least squares analysis, researchers investigate the intricate interplay of online social capital in shaping the nexus between service learning experiences and the advance of critical digital literacy competencies. These results showed that service learning increased critical digital literacy among preservice preschool teachers, and online social capital played a mediating role in this relationship between service learning and critical digital literacy. We should actively encourage preservice preschool teachers to increase their critical awareness by understanding vulnerability and experiencing reality from the perspective of community partners. In addition, we need to provide more service learning opportunities that incorporate online social capital to enhance their critical digital literacy. © 2024 by the authors.},

This study utilizes a nuanced, qualitative approach to determine how residents of Maryland are or are not seeking, leveraging, and using digital literacy (DL) education venues and resources/training to build and enhance their digital literacy skills. The findings were used to create a typology of learners and illustrative personas that educators can use to identify what type of learning experience is best suited to their community members. The findings support the recommendations that educators need flexibility in their DL educational approaches by fostering the luxury of ambivalence among learners. This can be done by prioritizing transferable skills that allow learners to be self-sufficient in their future DL skills educational needs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Conduct a scoping review to identify the approaches used to integrate digital literacy into undergraduate pharmacy programs across different countries, focusing on methods for education, training, and assessment. Materials and methods: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, we searched 5 electronic databases in June 2022: MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL. Three independent reviewers screened all articles; data extraction was conducted by 2 reviewers. Any discrepancies were arbitrated by 2 additional reviewers. Results: Out of 624 articles, 57 were included in this review. Educational and training approaches for digital literacy in undergraduate pharmacy programs encompassed a theoretical understanding of health informatics, familiarization with diverse digital technologies, and applied informatics in 2 domains: patient-centric care through digital technologies, and the utilization of digital technologies in interprofessional collaboration. Blended pedagogical strategies were commonly employed. Assessment approaches included patient plan development requiring digital information retrieval, critical appraisal of digital tools, live evaluations of telehealth skills, and quizzes and exams on health informatics concepts. External engagement with system developers, suppliers, and other institutes supported successful digital literacy education. Discussion and conclusion: This scoping review identifies various learning objectives, teaching, and assessment strategies to incorporate digital literacy in undergraduate pharmacy curricula. Recommendations include acknowledging the evolving digital health landscape, ensuring constructive alignment between learning objectives, teaching approach and assessments, co-development of digital literacy courses with stakeholders, and using standardized guidelines for reporting educational interventions.

Recognising these challenges as opportunities, the higher education sector is reimagining its approach to course design and delivery. In response, universities worldwide are diversifying their offerings with blended, hyflex, and fully online courses to enhance flexibility and ensure readiness for any future interruptions. A pivotal element of this transformation is the professional development of university teachers, equipping them with digital competencies to effectively design and deliver courses and programs in various modalities. This paper discusses the development of a targeted digital competency framework tailored to evaluate and address the professional development needs of university faculty involved in the design and delivery of more digitally enriched, blended, and online programs and courses. The framework also aims to facilitate communication and collaboration between key stakeholders, namely teachers, instructional designers, faculty developers, and academic managers. This paper outlines the current development stage of this framework, highlighting its rationale, intended functions, structure, and preliminary insights gained from its first validation phase.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Being digitally literate allows health-based science students to access reliable, up-to-date information efficiently and expands the capacity for continuous learning. Digital literacy facilitates effective communication and collaboration among other healthcare providers. It helps to navigate the ethical implications of using digital technologies and aids the use of digital tools in managing healthcare processes. Our aim in this study is to determine the digital literacy level and awareness of our students receiving health-based education in our university and to pave the way for supporting the current curriculum with courses on digital literacy when necessary. Method: Students from Acibadem University who were registered undergraduate education for at least four years of health-based education, School of Medicine, Nutrition and Dietetics, Nursing, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology, and Genetics were included. The questionnaire consisted of 24 queries evaluating digital literacy in 7 fields: software and multimedia, hardware and technical problem solving, network and communication/collaboration, ethics, security, artificial intelligence (A.I.), and interest/knowledge. Two student groups representing all departments were invited for interviews according to the Delphi method. Results: The survey was completed by 476 students. Female students had less computer knowledge and previous coding education. Spearman correlation test showed that there were weak positive correlations between the years and the “software and multimedia,” “ethics,” “interest and knowledge” domains, and the average score. The students from Nursing scored lowest in the query after those from the Nutrition and Dietetics department. The highest scores were obtained by Biomedical Engineering students, followed by the School of Medicine. Participants scored the highest in “network” and “A.I.” and lowest in “interest-knowledge” domains. Conclusion: It is necessary to define the level of computer skills who start health-based education and shape the curriculum by determining which domains are weak. Creating an educational environment that fosters females’ digital knowledge is recommended. Elective courses across faculties may be offered to enable students to progress and discuss various digital literacy topics. The extent to which students benefit from the digital literacy-supported curriculum may be evaluated. Thus, health-based university students are encouraged to acquire the computer skills required by today’s clinical settings.

	abstract = {Background: In today's society, a growing body of literature attests to the importance of young children's early digital literacy skills in their home environments and how acquisition of these digital literacy skills relates to their future learning and digital literacy. Objectives: Research on young children's digital literacy practices at home was reviewed to explore the positive and negative influences on early learning. This is important due to the children's rapid uptake of online digital technologies over the past decade. Methods: Peer-reviewed research articles on home digital literacy practices of children (aged 0–8 years old) published between 2010 and 2021 from four education databases were carefully selected based upon pre-determined criteria and examined using content analysis. Results and Conclusion: A high proportion of studies (29 of the 31; 93.5%) demonstrated significant benefits of young children gaining a range of skills, including digital operational, early literacy and language, socio-emotional, and STEM, through the use of digital technologies at home. Five of the 31 (16.12%) studies reported negative effects of digital technologies in the home context, including distraction, aggressive behaviour, and false self-confidence. Tablets and smartphone use gained greater momentum in the home context, especially between 2015 and 2021, and there was a positive shift in parental mediation, family involvement, and the children's home digital literacy practices. Implications: By leveraging children's acquisition of digital literacy skills in the home and taking into account the sociocultural context, we can enhance young children's preparation for the future and provide opportunities for skill development across various learning domains. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {This action research study was conducted in British Columbia and employed an embedded mixed-methods case study design. It used the technological pedagogical content knowledge framework as an analytical lens for exploring how teacher preparation and school information technology (IT) infrastructure mediate the use of technology in secondary science classrooms. The four study participants were purposely selected from within the science department at the researcher’s school and included the researcher herself. All participants were grade 10 science teachers who taught the course at least once in the two years before the study. Data collection commenced with the review of the grade 10 science curriculum, followed by an online teacher questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The data was triangulated to enhance trustworthiness, and the transcripts of the teacher interviews and the study manuscript were member-checked. The study findings suggest that teachers’ self-perceived low levels of technological knowledge, lack of technological training, and inadequate school IT infrastructure inhibit teachers’ and students’ engagement with technology. The study revealed relevant and context-specific insights that, in addition to addressing the initial hypothesis, can propel changes in how the school and the district mediate teachers’ and students’ use of technology across the district’s classrooms. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Maria Teresa Tatto; individual chapters, the contributors.},

The research shows that rural women learn digital skills, communication skills, and literacies in an unplanned and informal way within the family setting and their neighbourhood and through commercial activities in the local markets. The paper concludes that policymakers have much to learn from the unplanned and informal ways in which these rural women are developing their digital literacies in their everyday life through having access to smartphones. Therefore, using smartphones with informal learning approaches could provide a foundation for future literacy programmes. © 2024 The Author(s).},

Taking seriously how the pandemic forced many beyond the physical space of the university, the chapter contemplates how podcasts hold the potential of a decolonial curriculum that does not necessitate the land-based, militarized, and colonial project of the university. A project that has historically displaced and continues to displace Black, Indigenous, Chicanx, Latinx, and Asian-American communities through expansion. Podcasts create spaces of communal reflection, challenge the colonial practices of writing, reassert Indigenous practices of orality and storytelling, and produce a digital access space for students of colour, considering ability and class. The chapter provides grounded examples of the ways producing, learning from, and teaching podcasting are critical avenues for re-asserting students as active theorists and producers of collective wisdom toward better futures that are widely available for all respective communities. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Steve Gennaro, Nolan Higdon and Michael Hoechsmann; individual chapters, the contributors.},

This study explored how pre-service teachers (PSTs) perceive their digital attitude, efficacy, literacy, engagement, and understanding of digital technologies in an online learning environment. The study employed a mixed-methods research approach. A survey comprising Likert Scale questions and demographic information was administered to 110 PSTs from a regional university. Descriptive statistics were employed to investigate the relationship between PSTs’ understanding of digital technologies and their attitude, literacy, self-efficacy, and learning engagement in online learning. To illustrate the frequently used words in participants’ definitions of digital technologies, a ‘word cloud’ representation was utilised, accompanied by quantitative weightings of key terms. The study revealed significant connections between PST self-efficacy and their attitudes toward digital technologies, digital literacies, and learner engagement. Notably, most of the PSTs exhibited narrower definitions of digital technologies than anticipated. The implications of these findings for course design are discussed, emphasising the need to address PSTs’ perceptions of digital technologies, foster their self-efficacy, and enhance their digital literacy and engagement in online learning environments. Understanding these factors can lead to more effective integration of digital technologies in teacher education program courses, ultimately preparing future teachers for digital-age classrooms. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Anatomists are facing a new generation of learners who will study and work in a technology-rich environment. Indeed, digital technologies are tremendously changing how information and knowledge are communicated and retrieved. However, it remains unclear whether an anatomy assessment can be designed to promote contextual learning through integrating a digital communication strategy. To investigate this, assessment methods were diversified in the first-year neuroanatomy and third-year regional anatomy curricula through implementing a multimedia human anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacies and scientific communication. Through completing this multimedia assignment, students demonstrated their anatomy knowledge transfer using a range of approaches. The main mode of presentations chosen in the two anatomy units were non-animated video presentations (~50%), animated video presentations (~30%), storyboards (~10%), podcasts (~3%), and filmed videos (~3%). A 5-point Likert scale learning and teaching survey was conducted for a total of 195 undergraduate health science students to evaluate students' perception of this group assignment. The majority of students (70–80%) strongly agreed or agreed that the multimedia group assignment helped their teamwork skills. Students who produced animated videos significantly outperformed those who adopted the non-animated presentations during the end-of-semester theory examination (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that an anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacy and scientific communication is an effective assessment strategy associated with a positive learning experience and outcome. This inquiry-based assignment promotes learning through assessment, allowing students to not only consolidate and extend anatomy knowledge but also developing effective digital communication skills, providing new insights into non-didactic anatomy assessments. © 2023 The Authors.

The representative online survey of 322 respondents shows that three big competence sets can be identified: Awareness, Professional, and Digital. Those having higher scores in Professional competencies foresee more digital programs and communications in the future, and not only the digital competencies but also the professional ones should be developed to meet the requirements of the digital education transformation process. The findings emphasize that the forced and drastic changes in the application of digital education to the intensification of COVID-19 should become sustainable and find its proper place and role in the future HE.

However, this involvement must be gone with, mediated, and supervised by a responsible and knowledgeable adult, thus making digital resources helpful and beneficial for the progress of children’s different skills. The research we have carried out has focused, among other things, on the following goal: To understand the beliefs of kindergarten teachers and 1st cycle elementary school (1st CEB) teachers about the strengths and weaknesses of their digital literacy, to assess the different stages or levels of digital skills development. Data collection, using a questionnaire survey, was carried out in a school grouping in a city in the north-east of mainland Portugal. Considering the results obtained, it should be noted that some steps are being taken to implement digital literacy in educational contexts. However, we believe that some aspects can be worked on and developed to promote the use of digital technologies, to prepare children for a more digital, innovative, and creative age, without neglecting their safety and preferences. There are sometimes difficulties experienced by professionals that cause them to put off using digital technologies in their educational practices, either because of the age group they work with or because they are unwilling to invest more in their training. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {The erosion of essential competencies required for the development of digital literacy and critical thinking skills in the 21st century-attributable to factors such as underutilization of the internet for educational purposes, students' limited abilities in digital operations, information gathering, communication, collaboration, and a deficiency in critical analysis or selection of information-necessitates innovative educational strategies. The smart learning-based inquiry (SLBI) strategy, an advancement from traditional inquiry methods, aims to deepen understanding of learning concepts and problem-solving through digital technology application. This research evaluated the efficacy of the SLBI strategy in augmenting students' digital literacy and critical thinking abilities. Employing a quasi-experimental design with pretest-posttest control groups, the study utilized critical thinking tests and digital literacy questionnaires for data collection. Instrument validity was assessed using the Karl Pearson moment product test formula, yielding r values ranging from 0.465 to 0.724 for the test instrument and 0.556 to 0.945 for the questionnaire. Reliability was verified through Cronbach's alpha, with r values of 0.945 for the test instrument and 0.805 for the questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted to ascertain the strategy's effectiveness post-implementation. Results indicated that the SLBI strategy, encompassing six stages (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, designing digital reports, reflection, and publishing), significantly improved digital literacy (effect size 2.548, categorized as large) and critical thinking skills (effect size 1.504, also categorized as large) relative to traditional inquiry learning methods. These findings suggest that educators should consider incorporating SLBI strategies to enhance learning outcomes. Furthermore, the research opens avenues for future studies to explore the applicability of SLBI in fostering other competencies such as creative thinking, communicative skills, and learning motivation. ©2024 The authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: The significance of digital literacy in online social capital accumulation and surviving the contemporary society is widely recognised. Despite that the current generation is regarded as “digital natives”, their levels and nature of digital literacy vary. To generate educational insights, this study investigates the type(s) of digital literacy which are mostly related to the online social capital accumulation, and how one’s socio-economic background affects the connection between digital literacy and online social capital. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,747 participants aged 13–30 were invited to take part in a quantitative study. Spearman's rank correlation analysis, hierarchical regression analysis and mediation analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between participants' demographic background, engagement in the online platforms, digital literacy and online social capital. Findings: The results showed that the creative dimension of digital literacy was mostly significantly predictive of online social capital accumulation. Also, education significantly affected the relationship between the creative dimension of digital literacy and online social capital more than demographic background. Originality/value: Results suggest that education helps enhance digital literacy, offsetting the influence of socio-demographic background. The author examines the implications of how to implement training programmes in youth settings to enhance students' digital literacy and benefit those who are marginalised. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Therefore, this research explores teachers’ professional performance based on digital literacy, grit, and instructional quality mediated by teaching creativity. The research participants are 465 junior- and high-school teachers in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is utilized in the data analysis, along with common method bias and correlational and descriptive analyses. The results show a significant relationship between digital literacy, grit, and instructional quality and teaching creativity and teacher professional performance. Teaching creativity also has a significant relationship with teachers’ professional performance and mediates the influence of digital literacy, grit, and instructional quality on teachers’ professional performance. This finding promotes a new empirical model of the causal relationship between digital literacy, grit, instructional quality, and teacher professional performance through teaching creativity. Consequently, it is proposed that teaching creativity, grit, digital literacy, and high-quality instruction can all improve teachers’ professional performance. Therefore, in order to advance teachers’ professional performance in the future, practitioners and researchers should discuss, modify, and possibly even adopt the new empirical model. © 2024 by the authors.},

Objective: To assess the digital competencies of Peruvian basic education teacher. Methods: quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. The sample consisted of 125 teachers who were administered the Teacher Digital Competence Questionnaire, an instrument with adequate metric properties. Results: It was found that 44 % of basic education teachers had a medium level of digital competency, 36,8 % had a high level, and 19,2 % had a low level. Similarly, it was determined that certain sociodemographic variables such as gender and age group were significantly associated with the level of development of teachers’ digital competencies (p<0,05). Conclusions: The predominant level of development of digital competencies among basic education teachers is at a medium level. Therefore, it is recommended that educational authorities promote the implementation of workshops on the effective use of digital tools in the classroom, foster the exchange of best practices among teachers, and provide accessible digital resources and tutorials for autonomous learning. © 2024; Los autores.},

	abstract = {In an increasingly digitalised world, many older adults face the choice of improving their digital skills or risking social isolation and exclusion from essential services. With older adults expected to represent 16% of the global population by 2050, there is a renewed urgency to improve their digital literacy. Although many in-person and online technology training initiatives exist, they are often not accessible or poorly optimised for older adults. Younger adults, who typically form older adults’ support network, may be key to any solution. However, their help typically serves as a temporary fix until a new issue arises, leading to a cycle of dependency. This pilot study offers insights into the technology experiences of older adults, the ways in which younger individuals assist them, and how both groups stay connected. We conducted small-scale but in-depth user studies with older adults, and an online survey of younger adults, to understand how the technology support process could be improved to promote older adult autonomy and active ageing. Based on our findings, we propose an age-friendly platform that leverages intergenerational exchanges for a personalised learning experience that brings together younger and older adults. The final prototype was well received by participants in the user study. However, further exploration of other aspects of their lives and cultural differences in intergenerational learning, and larger studies of younger and older individuals are needed to co-create a solution that helps bridge the global digital divide while enabling older adults to have more fulfilling lives. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {Social and economic participation is increasingly dependent on the proficient use of digital technologies in everyday life. Digital skills, alongside literacy and numeracy, are now foundational skills that all Australians should have. Yet, how policy makers, scholars, and adult educators can effectively identify people’s current and desired digital skills is not well established. Existing frameworks tend to be instrumentalist, listing generic abilities that all citizens need for success. Digital abilities, however, are context-specific and attempts to generalise need to be responsive to local circumstances. We present a theory-driven Digital Ability Self-Assessment Tool, developed for a government agency and piloted in a community organisation. The Tool takes a distinctive socio-material approach to overcome shortcomings of other digital ability assessment tools, which often focus on normative measures of skills attainment. Overall, we argue that authentic digital skills policy and programme development must account for the contexts in which digital technologies are used. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The openness of science is gaining momentum in the digital era, prompting new visions, research methods, and innovations at universities. While the study of open science postulates and practices can expand the capabilities of future scholars, digital ones included, to provide a tentative action plan for research digitalization, foster cooperation, and transparency, improve research reproducibility, as well as enhance its visibility and significance, this issue, however, often remains overlooked when training specialists in higher education institutions. In an effort to combine the research practice of open science and the practice of training Ph.D. students in higher education institutions of Ukraine, we developed the elective training module “Digital technologies in modern scientific research: learning Open Science” in compliance with DACUM methodology. In our study, in terms of labor market requirements, we are guided by the need to train researchers capable of effective realization in the context of digital open science and explore the descriptors of researchers' digital competence (Jisc Researcher) as an expected outcome of postgraduate studies at universities. Results of experimental inspection of the developed module application in the process of master students learning at Borys Grinchenko Kyiv Metropolitan University have confirmed the relevance of its development and application while allowing to pinpoint certain problems. Accordingly, the prospects of further studies include bolstering the practical component of training and strengthening horizontal connections between universities and project teams in order for the Ph.D. students to gain the experience of scientific research digitalization and create the environment for Ph.D. students to form digital competencies in regards to digital proficiency, productivity, identity, and wellbeing. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

Video ethnography and qualitative content analysis were employed as research methods. The findings indicate that the teacher’s motivational scaffolding strategies in playful learning pedagogy included connecting with the preschoolers’ prior experiences and interests, promoting exploration skills, supporting the different developmental levels of the preschoolers, and encouraging them to participate in playful learning. The following motivational triggers were identified for preschoolers: 1) engaging in discussions about news, 2) exploring news through traditional and digital media, 3) utilizing digital tools, and 4) creating and engaging in news-related activities. The findings contributed to the development of a motivational design model for playful learning. © The Author(s) 2024.},

It has been argued that traditional education models, like structured 3- or 4-year undergraduate degrees, may not be the most effective way to prepare learners for their future working lives. In this chapter, we present a case study of Qwasar, a digital skills learning platform that uses experiential learning techniques to help learners develop programming skills alongside a broader set of skills relevant to the industry, like problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, teamwork, creativity, and flexibility. The findings and discussion sections of this chapter elucidate how experiential learning features in the pedagogical approach taken by Qwasar, and relatedly the impact of Qwasar’s programs in terms of workplace readiness and broader educational infrastructure. The contributions of this chapter are threefold: (1) provide novel empirical illustrations of experiential learning in EdTech, (2) problematize EdTech within broader debates about its aims and efficacy, and (3) suggest practical considerations those in this entrepreneurial space might want to consider. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Basel Hammoda and Susanne Durst; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Development of digital literacy and computational thinking among housewives lie in its potential to address a critical gap in the understanding of digital education and empowerment. This study seeks to ascertain the viability of family enterprises based on digital marketing. In detail, this study examines the relationship between entrepreneurship education, digital literacy, and business sustainability through computational thinking. Study participants and methods. This research involved a quantitative approach using a self-administered survey method. The population in this study were housewives in several regions in Indonesia and the data will be analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Sumatra, Java, and Bali homemakers participated in this study. The three islands represent Indonesia's west, center, and east regions. We offered 350 Google Forms questions sent via WhatsApp. Results. The results indicates that entrepreneurship education has a significant effect on business sustainability (t-value =16.620, p-value = .000), and computational thinking skills (t-value =10.916, p-value = .000). In addition, digital literacy has a significant effect on business sustainability (t-value =4.612, p-value = .000), and computational thinking skills (t-value =3.738, p-value = .000). Later, there is robust link between computational thinking and business sustainability (t-value =3.712, p-value = .000). The mediating estimation indicates that computational thinking can mediate the connectivity between entrepreneurship education and business sustainability (t-value =3.398, p-value = .001), as well as digital literacy and business sustainability (t-value =2.516, p-value = .012). Conclusion. Empowering housewives with entrepreneurship education, digital literacy, and computational thinking holds practical significance in managing their business and community development.

	abstract = {In the ever-evolving digital landscape, higher education (HE) students find themselves at the crossroads of two critical aspects: their digital competencies and their digital citizenship. Given the ubiquitous integration of digital technologies in educational settings, it is essential to investigate the relationship between students’ digital competencies and their ability to engage as responsible digital citizens. This study examined the nexus between digital competencies and citizenship among HE students. This study involved 247 students from a Ghanaian HE institution. Digital competency and citizenship scales were used as data collection instruments. The findings revealed that problem-solving, communication and collaboration, and digital content creation competencies had a significant positive influence on HE students’ digital citizenship. Conversely, safety competence has no significant influence on digital citizenship. Interestingly, data and information literacy competence have a negative effect on digital citizenship. The implications of these findings provide valuable insights for educational institutions, policymakers, and educators to foster digital competencies and promote responsible digital citizenship among HE students. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Scholars have long recognized that reading in digital spaces requires unique skills, strategies, and competencies in comparison to those needed for reading printed text. In recent years, the ubiquity of social media and algorithmically targeted content has radically changed the nature of online reading and meaning making. Technological changes have occurred simultaneously with radically altered sociocultural and sociopolitical contexts. To account for an altered technological and sociocultural landscape, new approaches to teaching digital reading and critical media literacy are needed. Addressing these concerns, this case study detailed a digital reading curriculum designed to be responsive to both the contemporary digital media environment and to students’ out-of-school digital literacy practices and contexts. The curriculum was collaboratively designed by five middle-school language arts teachers who participated in a semester-long professional learning group focused on digital reading. Drawing upon sociocultural, asset-based, and culturally relevant philosophies of education, these five teachers designed a unique digital reading curriculum. This study examined the nature of this curriculum. The findings detailed four aspects of the teachers’ unit: (1) digital reading instruction situated within students’ literate lives; (2) critical instruction regarding systemic features of the internet such as algorithms and clickbait; (3) lessons in which students interrogate socially situated meaning making; and (4) lessons focused on the role of emotions while reading online. The findings have implications for future digital reading and media literacy curricula intended to be responsive to students’ funds of knowledge, ever-changing literacy technologies, and new, emergent ways of reading and practicing literacy on the internet. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Nowadays, social media has become the most used platform to pick up information. Therefore, the increased number of social media users was not followed by the ability to distinguish between fake and authentic information online. There is a reason that drives someone to hold a specific belief since epistemic is a domain-dependent form that exists contextually. This study develops a scale with 33 items to investigate the variables of internet epistemic beliefs, digital literacy, and social media engagements. A total of 512 participants administered the survey using the snowball sampling method. This study generates five CFA analysis factors and concludes a model through an SEM analysis.

	abstract = {In the 21st century, ICT-based teaching has evolved into problem-solving (PS). Therefore, scholars from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have identified the factors that facilitate such a process in their classes. Therefore, empirical evidence on English language teaching is warranted to uncover what factors shape teachers’ professional competence to have such language classes. Thus, putting one step forward, this explanatory study explored the antecedents shaping language teachers’ 21st-century digital competence from a bi-level approach. As a result, 863 Iranian EFL teachers who taught English in various areas responded to instruments measuring their ICT-individual characteristics, schools’ ICT characteristics, and 21st-century digital competence. The partial least square structural modeling (PLS-SEM) showed that the teachers’ connectivity and computer for instruction (CI) in school improved their competence to analyze, browse, and evaluate language learners’ problems with it. Regarding their individual aspects, instructors’ technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), information access (IA), and perception of the benefits of ICTs were the main antecedents, leading them to become creative problem-solvers. Having examined the findings, the researcher offers teachers to enhance their approaches beyond teaching language skills with ICT to problem-solving. Curriculum experts should also invest more money and equip their schools with ICTs gadgets, increasing instructors’ connectivity and creativity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

	abstract = {This Research and Development aim to produce PBL-based mobile learning (Problem-Based Learning) material for human heredity that is valid, practical, and effective by digital literacy practice to enhance students' cognitive learning outcomes. The development model is based on Lee & Owens with four stages: analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation. Material experts, media experts, and learning experts validated the product. Biology education practitioners and student responses assessed the practicality of the product. The product's effectiveness is evaluated from the implementation to students with a pre-experimental design. Data were collected using validation sheets for validity testing, practicality sheets for biology education practitioners, student response questionnaires, worksheets, pretests, and post-tests. The validation test results by material experts, media experts, and learning experts are 100%, 100%, and 98.96%, respectively. The results of the practicality tests by education practitioners showed 97.86%. In contrast, the results of student responses through one-to-one trials, small group trials, field trials, and pilot tests were 92%, 92.6%, 90.9%, and 90.5 %. By practising digital literacy up to 81%, students' cognitive learning outcomes due to the effectiveness test increase to 62%. The paired t-test showed a significance of 000<0.05, so there was a difference between the pretest and post-test data. The study results concluded that the mobile learning developed was very valid, practical, and effective by digital literacy practice to enhance students' cognitive learning outcomes. This media deserves to be an alternative media in biology learning. © 2024 Author(s).},

The recent decline in historical literacy among Indonesians has piqued historians' interest. In this context, the gap between technological potential and literacy problems may be advantageous for initiatives to enhance Indonesian young historical literacy. This research uses a quantitative-descriptive approach. The respondents were first-year and second-year history students at UPI and UM. The data collection technique used was a historical literacy test that has Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) levels 1-4. This study used descriptive data analysis and an independent sample t-test. The results of this study show that students from both universities have a low level of historical literacy, both in first-year and second-year students. This condition is a signal for teachers to start improving. Gadget technology is suggested as a solution to the problem because these students belong to Generation Z (a generation that is very aware of current events and technological advancements). The methodology of Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL) was selected because its principles are appropriate for fostering digital historical literacy. It is student-focused, context-based, collaborative, methodical and well-developed in the community. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {We address the intersection between digital literacy and social education, particularly in socio-educational work with young people aimed at fostering their civic engagement. This challenge requires that social education professionals have holistic training in digital literacy, both in skills and critical digital knowledge. To find out their perceptions of their levels of digital literacy, we carried out a survey of the digital skills and knowledge of social education professionals (N= 144), looking at different sociodemographic variables. We proposed a bivariate analysis using correlations and a multivariate analysis with a multiple linear regression, taking critical digital knowledge as the dependent variable. The results show that, although sociodemographic variables have no effect on the level of critical digital knowledge, certain advanced technical and IT skills do have a significant influence. Finally, we discuss the possibilities for designing training focused on critical digital literacy, to improve performance working with young people. © 2024 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

Recognising the significance of MDC as an integral component for contemporary students, the relevance of cultivating mathematical digital competency for teaching (MDCT) becomes apparent. We posit that for teachers to effectively guide students in the development of their MDC, possessing MDCT is imperative. In this paper, drawing upon the theoretical frameworks of instrumental orchestration, the documentational approach to didactics, and the Danish competencies framework’s six didactico-pedagogical competencies of mathematics teachers, we propose a theoretical conceptualization of teachers’ mathematical and digital competencies in the context of teaching mathematics with technology. Expanding upon the preliminary definition of students’ MDC, we incorporate pedagogic, theoretical elements tailored to teachers, encapsulating it as MDCT. To expound on the various facets of MDCT, we provide an illustrative example featuring a mathematics teacher proficient in the utilisation of digital technologies and programming. © Crown 2024.},

	abstract = {Having good digital skills is essential today, yet little is known about the cognitive factors that influence the development of these skills. Given the importance of executive functions (EFs) in adapting to environmental changes and acquiring skills, EFs might contribute to acquiring digital skills too. EFs might also influence people’s approach toward ICTs and affect digital skills through emotional variables. Therefore, here, we tested whether cognitive control and flexibility are connected to computer and smartphone skills through emotional factors (learning confidence, stress, and attitude). A total of 269 participants (56 males, M = 30 years) filled out our survey which included questionnaires on demographic variables (age, education, and socioeconomic status), ICT motivation, digital skills, EFs, and technology-related emotional factors. EFs were also investigated through two performance-based measures. We used generalized linear models and structural equation modeling to test the associations between these variables. The results showed that smartphone skills were positively associated with self-reported cognitive flexibility through ICT learning confidence and technology-induced stress. Self-reported cognitive control and age were connected to smartphone skills directly. Self-reported cognitive flexibility was also associated with computer skills through ICT learning confidence. In addition, performance-based cognitive control and the level of education were directly linked to computer skills. These results may provide guidance to support digital skills and create digital skill training. © The Author(s) 2024.},

This study employed a novel conceptual framework built from ecological theory to investigate the attributions of the knowledge and skill gap in digital literacy among Ghanaian undergraduate students. A phenomenological qualitative design with a purposive sampling technique was implemented to collect data from 16 undergraduates in a large public university in Ghana in a four-months period. The findings show several factors responsible for students’ digital literacy knowledge and skills gap. Undergraduates have ascribed these reasons to various macro and micro factors. The students attributed their skills gap to personal, parental, institutional, and government factors, pointing to the need for concerted action from national and international policymakers and educators alike. This paper argues that university lecturers, administrators, the Ministry of Education, and policymakers in Ghana should collaboratively redesign comprehensive, persuasive, and integrated digital literacy approaches to benefit undergraduate students at all levels. © 2024, The Author(s).},

Theoretical framework: The theoretical framework was based on the studies of Van Deursen and Van Dijk (2014) that already addressed the theme of digital skills, but the present study sought to deepen and complement these investigations, exploring in more depth the concepts of "Computer Literacy," "Digital Literacy," and "Digital Competence." Methodology: The methodology included a search for articles in the Web of Science database, with a hundred citations or more that used the terms "Computer Literacy," "Digital Literacy," and "Digital Competence." From this search, Content Analysis was conducted with the technique of Descending Hierarchical Classification. Results: The results led to the creation of a framework with the main mentions about each selected term, organizing and systematizing the dimensions for digital skills. Conclusion: The research concluded that the three dimensions are interdependent, and a model that highlights their interconnections and overlaps can provide a clearer structure for the study of digital skills. Research implications: The research has practical implications, as the developed framework simplifies and operationalizes the concepts of "Computer Literacy," "Digital Literacy," and "Digital Competence," making them easier to understand and apply. This can help educators and professionals develop more effective teaching and training programs to improve individuals' digital skills. Originality/value: The originality and value of the research lie in the creation of a framework that systematizes and simplifies the concepts of digital skills, contributing to a better understanding and application of these concepts in the context of lifelong digital learning. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Design/methodology/approach: 21st Century Skills Teaching Scale, Internet based Epistemological Beliefs Scale, Internet based Reading Motivation and Engagement Scale as well as Digital Literacy Scale were used to collect the data. A total of 512 pre-service teachers from four universities in Türkiye participated in the study. Descriptive statistics, correlation and structural equation model fitness tests were performed by using SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 22.0. Findings: First, the results of the correlations analysis indicated that there were statistically significant positive correlations among measured variables. Second, the results of the path and SEM model fit tests demonstrated that all the model fit indices of X2/df, TLI, CFI, RMSEA met the acceptable criteria and were shown to be an adequate model structure. Finally, the results demonstrated strong evidence for predicting effects of digital literacy, epistemological belief as well as reading motivation and engagement on teaching 21st century skills. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by the fact that the evidence relies solely on pre-service teachers' self-reporting. Secondly, although the hypothesised model explained 45.2% variance of pre-service teachers’ competence in the 21st century skills, 54.8% of it remains unexplained.

This contributes largely to learners’ lower academic performance and hinders the effective teaching of economics in South African schools and thus forfeits the objectives of ICT usage in teaching and learning. Little is known about how teachers’ ICT skill deficiency can be addressed. In closing this knowledge gap, we investigated how can teachers’ digital skills be enhanced and how the Economics CAPS document can be amended to guide teachers towards a successful ICT integration. Guided by an interpretive paradigm, this qualitative study employed a case study design. Four schools were purposively sampled, document reviews and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. We found professional learning communities, continuous professional development and the introduction of ICT champions as contrivances in enhancing teachers’ digital skills. CAPS was reported imperceptible on how teachers can resourcefully utilise ICTs, thus restructuring, such that direct video conferencing links, and Moodle be incorporated to support teachers becoming techno-savvy and self-motivated individuals who innovative facilitators of ICT mediated lessons were recommended. Furthermore, policymakers, department and government should outsource funding to ensure that equipment needed for ICT integration is available and consider ongoing training for economics teachers which has implications for addressing worldwide ICT learning challenges. © 2023 university of Fort Hare},

Digital health interventions (DHIs) offer promise for personalized, and cost-effective health services, however, factors influencing their uptake remain unclear. We examined whether the probability of lifestyle DHI uptake varies among individuals with different educational levels and lifestyles, based on their attitudes and usage of e-services. We also examined the effect of sex and age, and the association between DHI uptake and both educational attainment and overall lifestyle. A possibility to start using a web-based lifestyle DHI was offered to a subgroup (n = 6978) of Healthy Finland survey participants and adjusted logistic regression models were used to investigate the factors affecting uptake. We found that higher education and healthier lifestyle, as indicated by lifestyle score, were related to higher odds of DHI uptake. However, the effects of age, sex, independence of e-service use, and competence to use online services varied across lifestyle score groups. No significant interactions were observed related to educational attainment. These results imply that lifestyle DHIs are less likely to reach individuals with less-healthy lifestyle habits and lower educational attainment. In addition, some predictors affected the uptake differently across lifestyle score groups, suggesting that implementations of DHIs might attempt strategies to optimize the participation rates in especially targeted subgroups. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Digital skills are crucial technical competencies for students in higher education institutions. Weaknesses among students in utilizing digital technology can lead to moderate levels of learning achievement, consequently impacting the future graduates’ marketability in the job sector. Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify the factors influencing the acquisition of digital skills among Technology with Education (TE) students at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). This quantitative survey involved a total of 87 final-year TE students from four programmes: Bachelor of Technology with Education; Electric and Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Building Construction and Living Skills at UTM. The study utilized a questionnaire with 21 items, encompassing three key factors: facilities, quality of teaching by lecturers, and study environment. Data analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 26.0. The findings revealed that the mean scores for all three factors were at a moderate level. Consequently, enhancing TE students’ digital learning experiences should concentrate on these three factors to augment their academic achievements in today's digital era. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Crucial for organizations' business performance, 21st-century digital skills have gained prominence. The Covid-19 pandemic's impact on individuals, education, and higher education institutions led to a shift from traditional face-to-face to remote synchronous learning. Students experienced diverse information and communication technologies (ICTs), while instructors adapted course structures, engaged in e-learning, and revamped online curricula. This study examines factors affecting students' digital skills acquisition, including instructor involvement, e-course quality, e-learning system usability, and e-course interactivity. Additionally, we explore the relationship between increased educational ICT usage and improved digital skills. Drawing from a survey of 624 higher education students in Pristina, Kosovo, and employing variance-based PLS-SEM analysis using SmartPLS 3.0, we find that active professor engagement in e-learning significantly influences digital skills acquisition. Ease of use and e-course interactivity also wield substantial effects, while e-course quality indirectly affects digital skills. Enhanced educational ICT usage positively correlates with creative and innovative skills development, enabled by content creation and ICT integration. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the potential enhancement of digital skills acquisition among higher education students. The findings indicate that increasing students' gaining digital skills through e-learning is indeed achievable through instructor involvement, e-course quality, ease of use, and increased ICT utilization. This study's insights provide a foundation for educators, institutions, and policymakers to make informed decisions on designing effective e-learning environments and strategies that promote students' digital skills in a rapidly evolving educational landscape. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Electronic patient records (EPRs), which require the digital documentation of all patient encounters, can be used to generate data that will inform strategies to improve patient care and patient safety. Nurse leaders at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust acknowledged that although ward nurses were providing excellent patient care, there were gaps in their digital documentation of that care. To address the issue, the trust implemented a model of education informed by data analytics and aimed at developing nurses' digital skills and increasing their engagement with digital workflows.

CONFINTEA VII embodied the worldwide interest in digital technologies through the use of a hybrid format with appointed delegates participating both virtually and on site. To highlight the importance of digitalization and digital skills, CONFINTEA VII not only devoted a plenary session to “Adult Learning and Education in Digital Environments,” but discussions about the role of digitalization and the need to support adults in developing digital skills also permeated other sessions such as “Preparing Adults for the Future of Work.” CONFINTEA VII sessions discussed challenges that vulnerable populations have in accessing digital tools and strategies for providing more equitable acccess and professional development to address this digital divide. This article describes learnings from CONFINTEA VII and related efforts at the national, regional, and local levels to support adult learners’ use of digital technologies to develop their literacy, numeracy, and occupational skills and the resources that are critical to those efforts. Also discussed is the need for data, research, and monitoring to understand how digital technologies can be effective in adult learning and education and in preparing adults to embrace a culture of lifelong learning. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As international benchmark studies on the digital literacy of prospective teachers with respect to their educational status can only be of limited significance in a federalized educational landscape, it is necessary to conduct regional and subject-specific studies using a survey instrument that is suitable for the relevant target group in order to provide specific training. For this purpose, the competencies of 185 prospective physical education teachers were surveyed at the beginning of the teacher training period in Baden-Württemberg (response rate 44.4%). This was based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) model using an online questionnaire on self-assessment and considering subject-specific content-related issues. The results show that the prospective physical education teachers feel well-prepared in terms of content (CK) and better prepared than pedagogically (PK) for an increasingly digital educational environment. They also feel confident in conveying content knowledge in a pedagogical manner (PCK), although the consideration of information and communication technology (ICT) in the classroom (TK, TCK, TPK, TPACK) still represents a barrier. Specific support for the pedagogical implementation of ICT (TPK) may have a positive influence on TPACK, also in an interdisciplinary context. In addition, the further research on TPACK should take into account the subject-specific nature in order to identify possible deficits and to be able to work constructively on them in the sense of target-oriented education. In this way, the teaching of theoretical knowledge should focus more strongly on the school context. Training with respect to movement skills should concentrate even more on technological aspects in the methodological integration in order to be able to effectively promote TPACK for prospective physical education teachers. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The article presents the results of theoretical generalization and empirical verification of the developed model of digital competencies of scientific and pedagogical staff of the Russian universities. A brief review of publications confirmed the relevance of the research and showed the main vectors of scientific search. The analysis of digital competencies of scientific and pedagogical staff of higher education was carried out by the method of an expert survey using a Google Form on the basis of the universities of Stavropol Krai (Russia). A total of 297 people took part in the survey. In the questionnaire of the expert survey, information modules were presented. They characterize the digital competencies of scientific and pedagogical staff of the university: information literacy, communication and cooperation, digital content design, security and responsible use of the online environment, organization of training in a digital environment. The results of the study allow us to update the model of digital competencies of scientific and pedagogical staff of higher education in Russia. It helps to describe their structural components: possession of the technological component of digital processes in educational activities; accessible and understandable positioning of the teacher and the subject area in the digital space, ensuring effective interaction in the “mentor - student” system; comprehensive digital security of educational activities. The empirical results obtained make it possible to develop additional educational programs for scientific and pedagogical staff, taking into account the actual need for the development of knowledge, skills and abilities in the subject area. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {Education informatization is one of the paramount issues in educational reform. To resonate with Chinese national progress in technology development and national policy for promoting education reform and modernization, this study ascertains the current status of education informatization and teachers' use of technology in teaching and learning in China. Data from a national survey on primary and secondary schools and teachers about the performance of education informatization was analyzed. According to the results, teachers' use of technology in teaching is a reinforcement of traditional pedagogy; innovative functions such as the communication and evaluation of teaching and learning are under-utilized. On the basis of this finding, promoting education informatization needs to promote teachers' coherent Digital Literacy (DL) integration competence. Meanwhile, a professional gap in using digital educational resources was found among teachers. The Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST) and the research team have put sustained efforts to guide the development of education informatization in China, and the results of this study serve as evidence for policymakers and principles to promote teacher professional development in line with the changes of new requirements for teachers' teaching ability in this information era. © 2023 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.},

The research that this study deals with was carried out on a sample consisting of N=125 students of the 3rd year of basic academic and professional studies in the study program of teacher in preschool institutions. As a research instrument, a five-point Likert-type scale of attitudes was used. The results show that there is a statistically significant difference in the attitudes of future teachers in preschool institutions when it comes to self-assessment of digital competencies before and after the implementation of online classes during the state of emergency in Serbia during the Sars-Cov-2 virus pandemic. The conclusion of the study is that the implementation of online teaching in processing the content of the Methodology of getting to know the environment affects the improvement of the digital competences of future educators when it comes to: 1) creating digital resources; 2) application of digital technologies in immediate educational work; 3) the role of digital technologies in professional development. The results of this research can be used to encourage teachers to step out of the usual pre-pandemic practice and enrich their pedagogical work with combined teaching (hybrid model) where part of the material would be analyzed in person, and part would be analyzed online using web tools, websites and videoconferencing applications. © 2023 by the authors.},

In addition to tracing how Western ideologies of technological transformation were imported into the design of ICT policy and curricula via international development organizations, the article contrasts the enduring routines and practices of hierarchical knowledge transfer in Ghanaian classrooms with assumptions about exploratory users embedded in the design of technologies primarily produced in and for North American contexts. In doing so, the article highlights the regimes of participation (Flamenbaum & George 2023), or the interplay between these taken-for-granted ideologies, technological affordances, and available roles for participation in knowledge production, which dynamically structure participatory engagements with digital literacies. Such a lens highlights the ways in which persistent policy framings of digital literacies as universal, neutral universal encounters between individuals and particular hardware or software enable and reproduce longstanding processes of disciplining marginalized populations. © 2024 iMasa.},

	abstract = {Assessing pre-service teachers’ digital literacy is challenging, particularly in inclusive education. Reliable and valid testing instruments are required to measure the digital literacy pre-service teachers possess in inclusive education. The entire research process comprises three phases. The first stage was to develop the assessment instrument, the second stage was to validate its content validity, and a pilot study was then conducted to test the reliability and construct validity of the instrument. The results of this study showed that item-level and scale-level content validity scores were both 1.0. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin is equal to 0.865. Five factors were extracted, explaining 54.40% of the total variance. The model fits were also all satisfactory. Standardized factor loadings of the instrument’ s 28 items were above 0.5. The values of Cronbach’s are higher than 0.7 for the five factors and the whole instrument. It can be summarized that the instrument had good reliability and validity and can be used to assess the digital literacy of pre-service teachers in inclusive education. There has been research into developing tools to evaluate the digital literacy of pre-service teachers. Still, few studies have addressed pre-service teachers of inclusive education, and this study fills this research gap. The subsequent phase involves evaluating it using a more extensive sample. © 2024, Modern Education and Computer Science Press. All rights reserved.},

An interesting situation is found when physical education must be conducted in contemporary style, but on the other hand, it must also be able to incorporate practice in the field. This study aimed to investigate the digital literacy level of physical education teachers. The sample in this study was high school teachers in Bojonegoro Regency, consisting of 12 physical education teachers. The sample selection technique used was total sampling. The type of this research is quantitative using a survey method. Data was collected using a questionnaire via Google Form. After the data were obtained and grouped, they were then analyzed using percentages. The outcome of this research was organized into three categories, respectively the low category of 25.06%, the medium one of 33.34%, and lastly the high category of 41.6%. Young teachers fill the high category in the level of digital technology usage. From the results of the Spearman test, the younger the teacher, the better the level of mastery in technology. The computer literacy of physical education teachers affects their use of technology in delivering learning. Several things are related to one another, namely digital literacy, signals, and internet usage. © Copyright 2023: Publication Service of the University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to describe a methodology that can be reproduced and adapted to any research into teaching practices incorporating digital technologies in connection with the development of students’ digital skills. The methodology is structured around the adaptation of an educational intervention model and can be broken down into three phases: pre-active, interactive, and post-active. For each phase, tools are proposed for collating expected, actual, and reflective practices, respectively. The value of this approach is that it takes into account the perceptions of all those involved: the teacher, the students, and the research team. It also considers and compares both the perceptions resulting from the expected and reflective practices of the actors directly involved and the research team’s observations of the actual practices. When applied iteratively, the perceptions can be analyzed to highlight areas of convergence and discrepancy. The methodology proposes to shed light on certain persistent gray areas in the literature to identify teaching practices and conditions conducive to developing digital skills and to clarify what needs to be considered to support their use. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Pierre Fastrez and Normand Landry; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {This study aims to bridge the gap between extended reality (XR) and digital literacy (DL) in popular science education and further develop a DL–XR framework. XR includes augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR, VR, and MR), which has received increased attention and has been used for educational purposes in recent years. However, the studies of XR in popular science education and its impact on students are scant. It is also challenging to find studies entailing XR and DL in education. This study not only offers an overview of the status quo of XR education but also is the first research presenting a referential framework that systematically integrates the many dimensions of XR and DL for future research and educational practices. XR has been extensively used in museums, benefiting users with immersive, authentic, hands-on, and interactive experiences. In the DL–XR framework, based on the variations of “individual-group” and “passive consumption-active creation”, eight dimensions of DL linked to XR are proposed, including “access and understanding”, “evaluation”, “ethics and well-being”, “interaction”, “collaboration”, “creation”, “problem-solving”, and “civic engagement and responsibility”. In the nurturing of DL, evidence revealed that XR is mostly used for learners to access knowledge/information and interact with virtual items; nonetheless, its applications for active creation, problem-solving, and collaboration are seldom prioritised. This study further proposes integrating project-based learning into XR pedagogical practices, which can maximise its impact on learning and empower the learners to achieve advanced levels of DL. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The digital skills divide has been raised as a serious issue during the COVID-19. However, few studies explored the predictive influence of personality traits on college students’ digital skills in online learning. To address this gap, this study took the second-level digital divide as the focus to conduct a two-round survey of college students over nearly 2 years based on cross-sectional and longitudinal methods to explore whether there is a digital skill divide or personality trait differences between urban and rural college students while learning online, and whether college students’ personality traits can predict their digital skills. The results confirmed the rural and urban college students’ digital skills divide. There were significant differences in all dimensions of their digital skills except for mobile skills. In addition, the digital skills divide of these college students persisted for nearly 2 years. Specifically, this study further confirmed that there were significant differences in the urban and rural college students’ extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness, but there was no significant difference in their openness and conscientiousness. Additionally, there was no change in the urban and rural college students’ personality trait differences in nearly 2 years. Personality traits could positively predict college students’ digital skills. This study provides evidence for bridging the second-level digital divide of the rural and urban college students from the perspective of personality traits. © 2023, International Forum of Educational Technology and Society.

	abstract = {In the field of education, the prominence of information and communication technology (ICT) tools in supporting learning and teaching has been steadily increasing. To effectively implement digital education, it is essential to foster teachers’ digital skills, especially in terms of tool utilisation and content development. The period of school closures during the pandemic and the subsequent transition to online education underscored the importance of participants’ digital preparedness. Online education posed many challenges for teachers, students and parents. After overcoming the initial technical obstacles, the methodological renewal of education emerged as a key issue. In the summer of 2022, our team conducted an online questionnaire survey involving 292 educators from nine European countries. Our research aimed to investigate online education during the COVID-19 period, encompaassing its positive and negative aspects, methodological considerations and the impact of online education on traditional classroom education. The research findings show that respondents consider the improvement of participants’ digital skills to be the most positive aspect of online education. However, they also highlight that this form of teaching provides limited opportunities to motivate learners and is less effective than face-to-face education. The outcome of this research hold practical implications, particularly in teacher training and in-service teacher training. It draws attention to the specifics of digital/online education and the possibilities of developing digital skills. © 2023 by the authors of this article. Published under CC-BY.},

This is marked by the use of internet technology that continues to grow rapidly with its capability to facilitate numerous human activities. One of the most important capacities of internet technology is its ability to expedite mobile learning leveraged by any profession. The dissemination of internet technology, however, requires digital literacy as well as information literacy performed by individual users. This study is conducted in an objective to examine the influence of digital and information literacy on the intention to use mobile technology for a learning purpose among Indonesia Gen Z. In addition, we also analyzed the mediating effect of performance expectancy between the literacy and intention relationship. This explanatory research employed a quantitative approach involving 155 Indonesian Gen Z respondents in an online questionnaire-based survey. Using Partial Least Square data processing technique, this study shows that information literacy has a significant effect on the intention to use mobile technology for learning while digital literacy does not. Besides, the statistical calculation results that performance expectancy has mediating effect only between information literacy and intention to use mobile technology for learning among Indonesia Gen Z. The business implication generated from this research shows that, since information literacy significantly forms Gen Z's expectation of mobile learning platform performance in Indonesia, Indonesia mobile learning platform providers are recommended to provide informative and alluring content to gain attraction and raise the satisfaction of using the mobile learning platform service.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Virtual exchange (VE) is an ideal venue for digital literacy skills development (Fuchs, Hauck & MÜller-Hartmann, 2012) and for critical digital literacy (CDL) (Hauck, 2019). Yet literacy is a fluid, deictic term, the meaning of which is context dependent, and digital literacies need to be defined and conceptualised within a specific context. Recent CALL literature highlights the interest in CDL from various perspectives, but how CDL is conceptualised by the VE participants themselves is not explored. Participants of this study were 37 trainee English language teachers in the UK and Turkey who joined a 6-week VE. Their ongoing reflections on CDL were captured through reflective e-portfolio entries following each VE task. Thematic analysis revealed four components of CDL in this specific VE: (1) participants' awareness of digital affordances for self-expression, (2) semiotic and interactional means to build connections, (3) ensuring inclusiveness of all community members, and (4) implications of socio-political contexts of each participant for meaning-making and interaction. We conclude that in future pedagogical implementations of VE, facilitators can foster trainee teachers' CDL development through more closely guided and informed reflection on the four themes presented in this paper. As such, this study makes a novel contribution to our understanding of CDL in VE settings for ELT teacher education by offering a social semiotic second language acquisition orientation within an interpretivist paradigm. © 2023 Cambridge University Press.

Despite educational researchers having long identified online teaching skills as necessary for teacher training, teachers were largely untrained and generally ill-equipped to teach online. Teacher-preparation programs are still lacking an emphasis in developing digital competencies, instead of focusing on the in-person, face-to-face teaching experience. This chapter is a case study of an undergraduate class specifically designed to help teachers learn skills and competencies related to online teaching and learning. The course addresses the online-teaching digital-skills gap with a two-pronged approach: (1) First, the design of the class follows proven, evidence-based practices for online instruction; and (2) second, each assignment of the course provides opportunities for students to develop technical skills through hands-on work, culminating in a digital storytelling project that puts all the skills to use. © 2023, IGI Global.

	abstract = {The use of digital tools in teaching and learning has become increasingly common in recent years. Even prior to 2020, their usage was steadily growing, but the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the early part of the current decade significantly accelerated their adoption. This trend has persisted even as the virus is no longer a pressing emergency, indicating that certain changes will have a lasting impact. Utilizing digital tools in education offers advantages, but it also presents challenges. Transitioning from using computers and other devices for everyday purposes to incorporating them into educational contexts is not as straightforward. In this research, we examine how students perceive higher education during the transition prompted by the pandemic. We conducted a survey among military and civilian students enrolled in security and defence studies, focusing on their experiences and perceptions as they undergo significant changes in their educational routines. Analysis of the questionnaire revealed that students encountered difficulties in various aspects, including establishing connections with teachers and experiencing the same level of engagement when unable to interact with them in person. An increase in the students’ perception of digital competencies was detected. This research is part of the activities undertaken in the European project DIGICODE, which aims to enhance the quality of education in security and defence by promoting the proper use of digital tools and fostering the development of digital competencies among both students and teachers. © 2023 17th International Conference on e-Learning and Digital Learning 2023, ELDL 2023 and 11th International Conference on Sustainability, Technology and Education 2023, STE 2023.

	abstract = {Digital literacy abilities in kids are crucial to study since they can help pupils gain 21st-century skills. The aim of this study was to look into primary school pupils' digital literacy in science classes. This study employed a descriptive approach in the form of surveys. The study included 200 pupils from seven Malang elementary schools. The research instrument was questionnaire based on four aspects that were produced by earlier researchers and had a reliability score of 0.95. Statistical descriptive approaches were used to analyze the research data. Findings showed that pupils' digital literacy skills differed in four ways. It produced a mean value of 2.40 in terms of using hardware and software, which was considered low. In the medium category, information processing and digital data received an average score of 2.62. In the medium category, it produced a mean value of 3.11 in communication and collaboration skills. In the low category, digital content creation received an average score of 2.32. Based on the findings, it can be inferred that elementary school pupils' digital literacy skills produced a mean value of 2.61 in the medium group. The findings implied that components of using hardware and software, as well as aspects of creating digital material, need to be enhanced. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

The population consisted of 5940 students from seven faculties of a public university in Lima, distributed in 53 study programs of the 2021-I academic cycle. A representative probability sample of 360 was established. These results are encouraging since they show that teachers are integrating ICT in the teaching-learning process. For example, 66.7% of students have perceived habitual management of technological tools in virtual classroom environments; this being a good level of didactic digital skills.

	abstract = {Education 4.0 is a part of Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0. Higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and digital literacy skills are suitable for education in this 4.0 era. HOTS emphasize critical thinking skills, analytical thinking skills, and creative thinking skills. This research aims to analyze the effect of the PjBL-HOTS learning model on students' critical thinking skills and digital literacy skills in learning osmoregulation concepts in the Animal Physiology course. Sixty-one fifth-semester students of Faculty of Teacher Training and Educational Sciences in Pattimura University, Ambon, were used as the research subjects. They were divided into class A (37 students) and class B (24 students). Class A was taught using the PjBL-HOTS learning model, and class B was taught using the PjBL learning model. The research instruments were in critical thinking-based essay test items and a scoring rubric to measure students' critical thinking skills. In addition, an observation sheet was used to observe students' digital literacy. The research data were analyzed using ANCOVA and ANOVA. The former was used to analyze the students' critical thinking skills, and the latter was used to measure students' digital literacy. The results showed that the learning model significantly affected students' critical thinking skills with 0.017<a=0.05. Meanwhile, the learning model did not significantly affect students' digital literacy, which was indicated with 0.249>a=0.05. This result shows that the PjBL-HOTS learning model with its complex syntax can empower students' critical thinking skills. Moreover, both the PjBL-HOTS and PjBL learning models can train students' ability to search information from digital sources properly. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Therefore, this study aimed to verify the influence of deep learning and higher-order thinking skills on higher education students’ digital literacy. Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the data gathered from 687 undergraduate and higher vocational students using a convenient sampling technique. The findings indicate that deep motivation and deep strategy were significantly positively correlated with students’ digital literacy. In such a structural relationship, digital literacy was additionally moderated by higher-order thinking. Nevertheless, students who have customarily used digital devices for more than five years could not be explained by this structural equation model. Lastly, this conclusion highlighted that educators should consider students’ digital experiences level, guide in selecting and applying deep learning, develop higher-order thinking, and improve their digital literacy. © 2023 Kassel University Press GmbH.

In this era, digital literacy has become a prerequisite for individuals, as its absence can lead to new vulnerabilities and inequalities, hindering the pursuit of sustainable development goals. Previous researches predominantly relied on questionnaires to assess digital literacy, often focusing on specific groups due to survey costs, making their methodology unsuitable for comprehensive countrywide measurement. To address these limitations, we propose FLAKE, a national digital literacy assessment framework. Within this framework, we devise a multi-task deep learning model called DLMaN, which employs mobile big data, such as users' digital behaviors, to predict citizens' digital literacy. FLAKE enables cost-effective assessment of digital literacy for massive citizens by surveying only a fraction of them and it also has valuable implications for other social research tasks. We test the framework's performance using authentic survey data and mobile big data, achieving RMSE and MAPE of 5.233 and 8.65% respectively, and the improvement is significant compared to the baseline model. We further employ this model to assess the digital literacy of numerous citizens in China and explore the implications for the society and individuals based on the obtained results.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Utilizing Critical Geragogy as an underpinning learning theory, WW.it aimed to provide a personalized intervention which encouraged older war widows to take an active role in digital skills training, working collaboratively with the instructor throughout (Braun and Clarke, 2006). To accomplish this, members of the WWA were given iPads and/or iPad training (Braun and Clarke, 2006). This mixed methods design, underpinned by Pragmatism (Feilzer, 2010; Morgan, 2014), allowed the research team to identify the self-reported impact of the WW.it programme, whilst gathering in-depth information regarding the implementation (see Braun and Clarke, 2006 for full evaluation). Instead of “Braun and Clarke, 2006,” “Wilson-Menzfeld et al., 2021” should be cited in these instances, linked to the following reference: Wilson-Menzfeld, G., Gates, J., Johnson, J., Moreland, M., and Raw, H. (2021). Exploring and Evaluating the War Widows InTouch (WW.it) Programme. Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Northumbria University. Additionally, in the Introduction, the word “Institution” in the text “Working with (Institution)”, and in the Materials and Methods, Design, in the text “Ethical approval was received from (Institution)'s ethical approval system”, should have been replaced with the name of the institution following peer review. “(Institution)” should be replaced with “Northumbria University”. The following corrections have been made to the article. Citation correction has been made to Introduction, Paragraph 7. The corrected paragraph is shown below. The War Widows' Association (WWA) is a registered charity with 1,941 members (as of November 2021). To be a full member, an individual must receive/have received a War Widows' Pension or Armed Forces Compensation Scheme 2005 payments. Any individual interested in the welfare of War Widow(er)s or in supporting the aims of the WWA can become an associate member. The WWA recognized issues of loneliness and social isolation across their membership, along with the desire of members to be connected to other members throughout the UK. Working with Northumbria University, the WWA designed a digital intervention, the War Widows InTouch (WW.it) programme, to address these needs and to connect older war widow(er)s (over 65 years old) at both a national and local level (Wilson-Menzfeld et al., 2021). The WW.it programme also aimed to increase digital access, digital confidence, and digital skills, as well as reducing fear and the impact of aging stereotypes on digital learning. Utilizing Critical Geragogy as an underpinning learning theory, WW.it aimed to provide a personalized intervention which encouraged older war widows to take an active role in digital skills training, working collaboratively with the instructor throughout (Wilson-Menzfeld et al., 2021). To accomplish this, members of the WWA were given iPads and/or iPad training (Wilson-Menzfeld et al., 2021). This project took lessons from “Project Semaphore” which was carried out by the Royal Naval Association and had similar project aims (Royal Naval Association, n.d.). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation and running of the WW.it programme changed significantly. Initially the programme was intended to be completed face-to-face, and in a group setting, but was ran remotely, online, and in a one-to-one setting. This training model allowed individuals to receive digital skills training at a time when the use of technology was being perceived as a fundamental part of everyday life. However, this is a very different model of training than had been previously considered. A correction has also been made to Materials and Methods, Design. The corrected section is shown below. This study is part of a larger, two-phase project which involved a mixed-method explanatory sequential design (Creswell et al., 2011). Mixed methods designs are typically chosen for evaluation studies to assess the impact of a programme, whilst also providing an in-depth view of the participant experiences to provide a more complete picture (Creswell and Clark, 2017). This mixed methods design, underpinned by Pragmatism (Feilzer, 2010; Morgan, 2014), allowed the research team to identify the self-reported impact of the WW.it programme, whilst gathering in-depth information regarding the implementation (see Wilson-Menzfeld et al., 2021 for full evaluation). This paper will focus on the data collected as part of semi-structured interviews across both Phase One and Phase Two only. Quantitative analysis from this mixed methods study is presented elsewhere (Wilson-Menzfeld et al., 2021). Ethical approval was received from Northumbria University's ethical approval system (ref: 120.3305).

	abstract = {Introduction. Digital literacy (hereinafter – DL) is a key element of the modern educational system, and its absence may lead to limited access to educational resources and unequal development opportunities. Monitoring of DL levels of pupils and students in the system of general (hereinafter – GE) and secondary vocational education (hereinafter – SVE) allows to identify strengths and weaknesses of digital training in the regional education system and to put forward cause-and-effect investigative hypotheses about the causes of digital breaks. The purpose of the research is to investigate levels and profiles of digital literacy among students in different educational institutions and to identify digital gaps in different parameters. Materials and methods. More than three thousand students from various types of educational institutions took part in the study, including general education schools, gymnasiums, lyceums and colleges of the Tomsk region (Russian Federation). The monitoring process used a previously developed operationalized model of DL adapted for the Russian education system. Methods of mathematical statistics (Kruskal — Wallis, Mann–Whitney, One-way analysis of variance) were used to compare levels and profiles of DL at selected levels of GE and SVE. Results. There are significant differences in DL between the level of GE as a whole and SVE (z = -3,824, p < 0,0001; z = -2,904, p < 0,004). Among the students of GE and SVE the highest levels of metacompetencies of information literacy and content creation (primary general education (hereinafter – PGE)– 64%, basic general education (hereinafter – BGE) – 66.8%, secondary general education (hereinafter – SGE) – 71.2% and SVE – 71.4%), the lowest – level of metacompetency of interaction and communication in networks (PGE – 73%, BGE – 50.2%, SGE – 66.8% and SVE – 59.8%). Conclusion. The monitoring of digital literacy in the regional system of general and secondary vocational education has shown that there are many gaps and disparities both within individual digital literacy profiles and at different stages and levels of education. DL gaps among learners are caused by gaps in digital training at educational institutions, unequal access to infrastructure, and socio-economic and cultural inequalities. The analysis of the digital divide will lead to the development of recommendations and strategies aimed at bridging the DL gap. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {These study purposes are to map the digital competency of pre-service math and science teachers and investigate how science learning can answer the challenge of digital competencies (DigComp) needs. This research used Rasch Model analysis to make knowledgeability mapping of the subject and analyzed using Wright map output by Winsteps 5.3.4. Data was gathered from a survey of 328 pre-service teachers of science majors, e.g., Biology, Chemistry, Geography, or Math, using the DigComp Framework-Based Questionnaire (DFBQ). The responses were based on respondents’ diverse demographic profiles (gender, region, living area, and field of study). The findings identify several differences in teacher training students’ knowledgeability of digital competencies that the Wright map in the Rasch model can map. Knowledgeability mapping is essential to determine which part of DigComp still needs to be strengthened with science education in the context of Science, Technology, Engineer-ing, and Mathematics (STEM) implementation. The study yields two main conclusions: 1) The mapping study of pre-service math and science teachers’ knowledgeability in the DigComp framework shows Logit Value Person (0.31<LVP<1.11) and Logit Value Item (LVI > 0.66 logits); (0 ≥ LVI ≥ 0.66) that are reflecting a middle to lower level of competency, and 2) Science learning has high potential to address this challenge through its learning strategy implementations. The findings can be recommendations for future research of knowledgeability mapping and policy development and discuss implications for digital competency framework practices. © 2023 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.},

	abstract = {The creative industries play an important role in economic, cultural and social life, and in many creative disciplines much of the workforce is made up of individual practitioners including freelancers, sole traders and small or micro enterprises. These talented creatives often need to be responsible for their own ongoing learning within challenging and ever-evolving digital and technological domains. Whether their creative practice is primarily analogue or digital, Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) and digital platforms are being adopted for use in many phases of the creative production and dissemination process. By necessity, much of the learning that creatives undertake during the adoption of technologies is self-directed, informal, and often involves peer-to-peer support. This is an important contextual factor that HCI research needs to address when developing tools and support systems for this user group. This one-day workshop will bring together participants from the HCI, creative and educational communities to discuss and share knowledge of technology learning and skills acquisition for working creatives. The workshop aims to examine ideas, strategies and experiences around supporting digital literacy, competency and confidence. The goal is to develop further collaborative research addressing support structures and frameworks in the area of informal learning about digital creativity tools for working practitioners. © 2023 Owner/Author.},

However, the influence of such a competency on L students’ perceived emotions has remained under-research. To fill this lacuna, this study used a quantitative design via three questionnaires to investigate the predicting role of students’ digital literacy (DL) in their perceived enjoyment and online learning self-efficacy (OLSE). To do so, a sample of 987 Chinese English as a foreign language students, at university level, were invited to partake in the study. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrated that DL could predict about 95% of changes in the participants’ FLE (β =.949, p <.001). Furthermore, it was found that about 92% of changes in Chinese students’ OLSE could be significantly predicted by their DL (β =.916, p <.001). Drawing on the obtained results, the study presents discussions and implications for L2 educators regarding the role of digital literacy in students’ perceived emotions. © 2023, De La Salle University.},

This study focused to investigate the extent to which online information-searching strategies (OISS) and digital literacy (DL) can predict LL competencies. The sample consists of 1658 high school students. The convenience sampling approach was used to select the sample. The dataset was collected using the “Key Competencies Scale in Lifelong Learning”, “Online Information Searching Strategies Inventory”, and “Digital Literacy Scale”. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that DL levels and OISS significantly predicted LL competencies. In predicting LL competencies, it was concluded that the best predictor was DL levels. DL independent variable explained 27.7% of the total variance. Also, it was determined that DL levels and OISS explained 34.2% of the total variance of LL competencies and that independent variables affected the dependent variable at a large level (R2 = .342 > .26). In line with the findings of the research, suggestions were made to determine and increase DL levels and OISS to increase their LL competencies. © 2023, Ozgen Korkmaz. All rights reserved.},

Students have to complete exercises and lectures as scheduled during their daily study. Students were required to participate in classes or exercises individually, as agreed upon with the instructor, through an external study method with a timetable for their educational activities. Beginning in 2020, distance learning (which took place online) was added, changing this. Moodle seemed no longer sufficient; thus, Microsoft Teams was adopted to handle large-scale online collaboration. The paper addresses the benefits and drawbacks of the platforms, as mentioned earlier and analyses the survey results obtained from UNIZA students. Students have become somewhat accustomed to distance learning while developing their digital skills through various programs and software. Some applications were made available to them thanks to MS Teams. Students learned to develop their logical, technical, and analytical thinking potential. They had to learn to work independently and with new platforms. This experience can give students a competitive advantage in the job market. © 2023 Garbarova et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction. In modern socio-political and economic conditions, the results of the professional activities of special and inclusive education teachers are influenced by various key factors, namely, digital competencies such as information, communication, information security and technological. The study aims to analyze and evaluate the development of digital competencies of special and inclusive education teachers and their impact on professional activities. Materials and methods. The impact of digital competencies on the effectiveness of professional activities of special education teachers was assessed through content analysis of the results of a questionnaire developed using Google Forms and of methodological materials provided by respondents. 467 teachers of special and inclusive education system of various constituent entities of the Russian Federation took part in the study. The obtained data were processed using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software. Correlation analysis was used for statistical data processing. Results. The survey showed that 2% of respondents with up to 20 years of work experience and 3% of respondents with more than 20 years of work experience noted a low degree of influence that development of digital competencies has on the results of professional activities; 59% of respondents with less than 5 years of work experience rated the degree of such influence as high. Interpretation of the results obtained showed a certain correlation between the professional activities effectiveness in this category of teachers and formation of the studied competencies according to such assessment parameters as age, level of education, and period of professional activity. Conclusion. Analysis of the results identified a number of patterns indicating the need to create conditions (material and technical support, opportunities for self-education and professional growth, various forms of training and internship, etc.) for systematic development of digital competencies among teachers of special and inclusive education. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

The study aims to describe the LMS3 implementation in school physics lectures to train digital literacy and elucidate an enhancement of prospective physics teachers’ digital literacy in school physics lectures using LMS3. One-group pre-test-post-test design was conducted on 38 prospective physics teachers who enrolled in school physics lectures. The instruments consisted of digital literacy tests, lecture implementation forms, and interview guides. Besides, LMS3 is an application designed independently using the ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) development model. The learning process using LMS3 occurred synchronously after the lecturer activated the learning process menu and adopted problem-based learning syntax. In general, the enhancement of digital literacy of prospective physics teachers after attending school physics lectures using LMS3 was the high category (N-gain = 0.72). In conclusion, school physics lectures using LMS3 had a significant impact on enhancing digital literacy. This study suggests developing lectures using various technologies that support the improvement of teacher competence in facing challenges in education. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In addition, this study revealed how the variables correlated to the lecturers’ EFL teaching performances. Therefore, a correlational design with a descriptive explanation model was conducted. The participants were six EFL lecturers from six different universities in various cities in East Java Province, Indonesia. The data were collected by administering TPACK-SAMR DLC and technostress questionnaires, conducting a semi-structured interview, and documenting the teaching scenarios. The results showed that most participants were more confident with their pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge. They claimed it was hard to mingle them into harmonious teaching performances with technology that challenged them to achieve the higher TPACK-SAMR DLC level. Relevant to this finding, their DLC had a negative ‘very high’ correlation with technostress, shown by-.824 Pearson correlation coefficient. Henceforth, their EFL teaching performances reflected the minimum operation of technology, according to SAMR stages, to mediate EFL teaching by substituting and augmenting the technology. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of DLC training to escalate the positive outcomes of EFL teaching with technology and minimize technostress. © 2023 by authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas, CY.},

Theoretical framework: The theoretical framework was based on the studies of Van Deursen and Van Dijk (2014) that already addressed the theme of digital skills, but the present study sought to deepen and complement these investigations, exploring in more depth the concepts of "Computer Literacy," "Digital Literacy," and "Digital Competence." Methodology: The methodology included a search for articles in the Web of Science database, with a hundred citations or more that used the terms "Computer Literacy," "Digital Literacy," and "Digital Competence." From this search, Content Analysis was conducted with the technique of Descending Hierarchical Classification. Results: The results led to the creation of a framework with the main mentions about each selected term, organizing and systematizing the dimensions for digital skills. Conclusion: The research concluded that the three dimensions are interdependent, and a model that highlights their interconnections and overlaps can provide a clearer structure for the study of digital skills. Research implications: The research has practical implications, as the developed framework simplifies and operationalizes the concepts of "Computer Literacy," "Digital Literacy," and "Digital Competence," making them easier to understand and apply. This can help educators and professionals develop more effective teaching and training programs to improve individuals' digital skills. Originality/value: The originality and value of the research lie in the creation of a framework that systematizes and simplifies the concepts of digital skills, contributing to a better understanding and application of these concepts in the context of lifelong digital learning. © 2023 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The aim of this research is to find out about the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and two groups of digital technologies and the effects of this use. The tools analyzed were: i) six digital tools for communication and ii) nine digital tools for instructional design, in a group of 108 practicing teachers, aged between 23 and 65 years. They participated in this study by answering an online questionnaire called EDU-COVID [1]. Most of the teachers worked in public schools (69.4%), in several autonomous communities in Spain. The largest representation was from Castile and Leon (39.8%).

Based on the disciplinary pedagogical technological knowledge (TPACK) model, it is intended to measure the correct inclusion of technologies in the classroom. For this, a descriptive exploratory methodological design study was carried out. The instruments used have been the Likert scale questionnaire and the personal interview, organized into four dimensions in which the self-perception of professional ethical knowledge, ethical knowledge of technology, pedagogical technological ethical knowledge and disciplinary technological ethical knowledge of the future teachers. The questionnaire has been applied to a sample of 1.051 trainee teachers from a European university in the context of COVID-19 and 822 students participated in the interview. The results show the scarce training in professional ethical knowledge of teachers in training and the importance of addressing this knowledge in the 21st century, a post-pandemic context. Another of the conclusions is the need to include the ethical component in the TPACK model to achieve a correct and ethical use of digital resources in the classroom. © 2023 by authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas, CY.},

However, no study has been conducted on the correlation between and effect of CSE, DL, TL, and IL and which additionally explains their relationship to each other. This study aims to analyze the effect levels among the latent variables of DL, TL, and IL, and the attitude toward applying CSE and these latent variables’ ratios to each other. For this purpose, eight hypotheses were developed after reviewing the literature. A relational descriptive model is used to detect the presence and extent of covariance. The participants of this study were 510 prospective teachers. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the scales were performed. The hypotheses of the research were tested with the structural equation model. As a result, it was revealed that DL, TL, and IL together significantly affect and explain the attitude towards CSE.

The purpose of this research is to examine the levels of digital parenting attitudes of preschool parents, and the levels of digital literacy and digital data security awareness of preschool teachers and parents, and then to investigate whether these variables show general relationships with change. Designed as quantitative research, this is a correlational study. We recruited a total of 410 participants from preschool teachers and preschool parents. We used a personal information form, Digital Parenting Attitude Scale, Digital Literacy Scale, and Digital Data Security Awareness Scale as data collection instruments. Our results show that preschool teachers' digital literacy and digital data security awareness levels are higher than those of preschool parents. There is evidence that there was a statistically significant difference between digital literacy and digital data security awareness. Accordingly, we recommend that teachers should cooperate with parents on digital literacy and digital data security awareness. Further, school principals should make their greatest efforts to make this cooperation sustainable. Several activities should be conducted to boost digital literacy levels of both parents and students, and thereby increasing their digital data security awareness. © 2023, Ozgen Korkmaz.

This study showed that university students' digital literacy skills and mobile English learning attitudes were high and their digital literacy skills have a moderate and positive relationship with their mobile English learning attitudes. Besides, it was concluded that university students' digital literacy skills significantly predicted their mobile English learning attitudes and they together explained 50% of the total variance on their mobile English learning attitudes. Also, university students' scores on the attitude subscale of the digital literacy scale presented the largest effect on their mobile English learning attitudes. © 2023, IGI Global.},

Using a cross-sectional survey sent to a stratified random sample of 2500 undergraduates representative of the overall student population at a medium-sized Canadian undergraduate university (survey response rate of 19.8%, N = 496), we explored the relationships between social media and digital literacies, particularly in different disciplinary contexts. We also explored the ways in which students report using social media in their university learning, showing that students value social media for collaboration, discussion, information finding and sharing, and practise activities related to their learning. Additionally, we examined the importance students place on DL, and how they perceive and rate their own abilities with digital literacies across three domains: procedural and technical, cognitive, and sociocultural. Findings illustrate an observable gap between the high importance that students place on digital literacies (including DL for social media) in their learning and their lives and the lack of coverage students reported receiving about these topics in their undergraduate education. Based on the study’s findings, we discuss the specific ways that those in the higher education community can address this gap by engaging with and fostering development of digital literacies within specific disciplinary and professional contexts, and in interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary learning settings across the curriculum. © 2023, The Author(s).},

In this law called LOMLOE, the development of digital competence becomes the top priority, and teachers must work on it in all school subjects. Moreover, this law makes the work of mediation explicit for the first time as a specific competence of foreign language learning which will allow us to propose the rehabilitation of FLE’s ongoing translation. We see translation as a strategy that promotes the development of the competence in mediation, so that is why we propose to work on audiovisual translation, and more specifically on the subtitling, as an activity that makes it possible to integrate into French courses in secondary education, the work of digital competence and language communication skills as recommended by the LOMLOE. To illustrate this proposal, we present some activities to address captioning as the final task, using digital tools. © 2023 GERFLINT. All rights reserved.},

Accordingly, students must be digitally literate to enhance their distance learning sessions. On the other hand, some distance learning students are less aware of the importance of digital literacy competencies. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to assess the digital literacy competencies of distance learning students. A survey was conducted by distributing an online questionnaire during the academic session from May to November 2021. A total of two hundred and thirty-two students participated in the survey. The outcomes revealed that the students demonstrated adequate digital literacy competencies throughout the distance learning sessions. Nevertheless, students are encouraged to upskill for understanding the most recent digital technologies better, allowing them to use the most recent digital technologies in their learning and workplace. © 2023 Author(s).},

Using students’ own personal data as part of improving their own wellness would seem to be a natural fit given that most university students are already data and information literate. In this work, we aim to show how the interplay between health literacy and data literacy can be used and taught together. The method we use is the development and delivery of the FLOURISH module, an accredited, online-only but extra-curricular course that delivers practical tips in the areas that impact students’ everyday wellness including sleep, nutrition, work habits, procrastination, relationships with others, physical activity, positive psychology, critical thinking, and more. For most of these topics, students gather personal data related to the topic and submit an analysis of their data for assessment thus demonstrating how students can use their personal data for their benefit. More than 350 students have taken the module and an analysis of the use of online resources, as well as feedback on the module experience, are presented. The contributions of this article are to further endorse the need for health literacy and digital literacy for students, and we demonstrate that these can be taught together making each literacy more appealing to the digital natives of Generation Z who make up the majority of students. The implications for public health research and practice are that two student literacies, health and digital, are not independent and for our students, they should be taught together. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Digital literacy refers to the ability to communicate with others by using digital technology, including the ability for sharing knowledge and information after user’s creation. A survey was conducted on 212 pre-service early childhood teachers at two Universities located in the eastern United States, and the collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hierarchical multiple regression. As a result of the study, first, pre-service teachers had high critical thinking among the sub-factors of digital literacy, but relatively low problem-solving skills. Second, the relationship between digital literacy, self-efficacy, and the perception of AI education for young children showed a positive correlation. Third, among the sub-factors of digital literacy of pre-service early childhood teachers, technical application, learning interaction, and problem-solving with teachers’ self-efficacy were found to have a significant effect on the perception of AI education for young children. This study proposes that developing a pre-service teacher education program that can improve their digital literacy and self-efficacy is necessary for guiding early childhood teachers to use artificial intelligence technology with young children in early childhood education classrooms in educationally meaningful ways. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Participants included 1633 middle school students from central and southern China. Results indicated that ICT utilization had a significant positive effect on learning achievement, and digital literacy played a mediating role in the relationship between them. Further, ICT utilization affected learning achievement through the chain mediating role of digital literacy and problem-solving ability.

The development of the digital world is opening up a wide range of new possibilities for sharing and collaboration across numerous industries. Digital competence is one of the crucial skills that instructional staff members must possess. The necessity for the adequate acquisition of novel information capabilities in the information society has been one of the key forces behind curriculum change. Although digital technologies are increasingly being used in education, it's important to understand how they might be used to progress educational reform and enhance effective pedagogical techniques. Teachers should be mindful that technology will affect the teaching strategies they employ. The transfer of 21st-century core competencies requires that instructors exhibit digital proficiency. The development of digital teaching abilities is a challenge for teacher education needs to be a priority for the education institutes should be a priority in education public policy. © 2023, IGI Global.

	abstract = {Background: Globally, digital skills are a crucial aspect of education that schools should develop systematically. Research on digital skills tends to be measured using self-reports, performance tests or interventions. There is less knowledge about student and teacher uptake of technology in school, making it important to investigate the actual use of technology and digital skills in authentic classroom settings. Objectives: This study contributes unique baseline data concerning students' use of technology and digital skills across mandatory English courses in real classroom settings in secondary schools in Norway over time. Methods: The study adapted a national framework for digital skills into an observation protocol. With it, this study analysed videos from 60 naturally occurring English lessons in 13 English classes at seven lower secondary schools over two school years (grades 9 and 10), following 186 students (aged 13–15) and 10 teachers. Results and Conclusions: Students used digital skills critical for education in half of the video-recorded English lessons, with more digital skill use at some schools over time. The main finding across classrooms and school years regards students' use of basic, not advanced, digital skills. Takeaways: Although teachers provide opportunities for students to use digital skills in school, more advanced skills are needed. This work calls for continued use of video recordings to provide systematic comparisons of potential shifts in students' digital skills in real English secondary classroom settings over time. © 2022 The Authors.

The objective of the system is to allow the actors, students, teachers, researchers, administrative and technical staff to develop and strengthen their digital skills. It is a matter of allowing individuals to evaluate themselves to self-regulate. The design of the platform is organized around a framework of digital skills, which is based on the DigComp framework of the European Commission and the Digital Capabilities Framework of JISC. The MakeITeasy platform is organized around four components: 1) a self-positioning test, allowing people to situate themselves in the reference framework; this test produces 2) an individual digital skills profile, which offers then to compare oneself to 3) target profiles to be reached; and finally, 4) a recommendation system which lists training courses to fill the gaps in one's skills. The platform is currently being developed for the students, doctoral students, and teacher populations. The self-positioning tool covers the generic competencies of the reference framework in its entirety while being as concise as possible so that it can be completed in full. The questions are based on occupational situations because the context to which they are attached makes it easier to assess the mastery of the skill by different categories of members of the university community. The tool presents the same generic competency at least three times in different scenarios and uses the responses to the three situations to decide the level of mastery. The test situations and questions as well as the entire platform were evaluated by various user tests. © 2023, EasyChair. All rights reserved.},

However, student teachers do not really possess DLS and are unable to apply them to their teaching methods, so the digital storytelling media via gamification to enhance DLS: DSML(Digital story model learning) is needed as an instrument to support them in acquiring digital literacy. The objectives of this research were to analyze the factors of the DSML and to assess the model appropriateness. The study was implemented through 42 papers of relevant articles and research from specific primary and secondary sources. The research instruments included lesson plans, the learning model, assessments of DLS, and assessments of workpieces. The findings of the study show that the factors of model consist of activities through DSML in 2 aspects with 10 factors and 29 variables. The test was validated by experts for the appropriateness of the learning through DSML. Overall, the DSML was found to have the highest appropriateness level (mean = 4.62, S.D. = 0.13) so it can be used in real learning and teaching situations and it is helpful for enhancing students’ DLS in the design and development of digital media. Based on the findings, the students could extend their learning scope with DLS in building digital media. These skills are necessary for Thai teachers in the future, and the model can be a prototype for doing classroom-based research or presenting research work at a national level. © 2023 by the authors.},

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions conducted either in person or through Zoom. This study revealed that digital literacy self-efficacy of caregivers did not negatively affect the involvement they had in their students’ distance learning. There was also an increase in involvement no matter the computer comfortability of the caregiver and the challenges they faced throughout distance learning. The results of the study help inform district and school personnel on how to provide clear communication to caregivers and offer training for digital tools used throughout distance learning. Additionally, it guides districts on how taking the time to plan and create structure can provide caregivers a sense of comfortability knowing schools have a plan in place. © (2023), (California State University).

	abstract = {In the swiftly evolving realm of education, digital learning has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing how learners and educators interact with knowledge. This paper delves into the intricate interplay between digital learning abilities, instructional design, and learner support, particularly within the context of blended learning, where traditional educational paradigms merge with technological advancements. Blended learning, the fusion of in-person and digital instruction, necessitates a delicate equilibrium to unleash its full potential. We explore the multifaceted attributes that underpin self-regulation within these environments, such as authenticity, personalization, and scaffolding. Moreover, we investigate how blended learning’s effectiveness transcends various educational domains, from vocational schools to mathematics education and entrepreneurship training. The paper underscores the significance of comprehensive learner support and skillful instructional design. It highlights the symbiotic relationship between blended learning and the cultivation of digital literacy, encompassing not just technical prowess but also critical thinking and purposeful digital engagement. As educators embrace these insights, they stand poised to create dynamic educational experiences that empower students for the digital age. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate the effects of digital literacy and self-esteem on dental students’ perceptions of professional competence and to provide recommendations for improving educational programs in dental schools. A mixed-methods, descriptive, and relational scanning design was employed, using a questionnaire comprising demographic information, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Digital Literacy Scale (DLS), and the Professional Competence Scale (PCS). The sample included 427 dental students in Istanbul, Turkey. Statistical analyses included Cronbach Alpha, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Mann–Whitney U, Kruskal–Wallis, Spearman’s rho correlation, and the Generalized Linear Model (Logit Model). The majority of participants were female (65.6%), aged 21 or older (85.2%), and in their 4th grade of study (35.2%). There were no significant differences in PCS scores concerning gender, age, grade, type of residence, and residence location (p > 0.05). However, PCS scores were significantly higher among those who listed dentistry among their top five preferences, expressed high satisfaction with education, and demonstrated high professional interest (p < 0.05). A significant, positive correlation was observed between PCS and RSES (r = 0.398; p < 0.01), DLS (r = 0.404; p < 0.01), preference (r = 0.120; p < 0.05), education satisfaction (r = 0.298; p < 0.01), and occupational interest (r = 0.502; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the Logit Model analysis revealed that RSES (B = 0.290; p < 0.01), DLS (B = 0.258; p < 0.01), education satisfaction (B = 0.806; p < 0.05), and occupational interest (B = 3.825; p < 0.01) significantly influenced PCS. The findings underscore self-esteem and digital literacy’s integral role in shaping dental students’ perceptions of their professional abilities. Digital literacy is a substantial pillar supporting students’ professional competency. Coupled with a genuine interest in the field and bolstered self-confidence, digital literacy proves instrumental in enhancing students’ academic success in dentistry. By emphasizing and expanding upon digital literacy content within the curriculum, universities can further propel advancements in the dental domain. As such, it is pivotal for dental institutions to weave strategies into their educational fabric to elevate students’ self-esteem and digital proficiency. © 2023 by the authors.},

The mission of an interdisciplinary team of teachers of Visual Arts Education and Mathematics is to use the power of the arts for opening creative channels in students to arrive at the deeper understanding visually. Our intervention addressed negative attitudes to learning and verbalisation in knowledge production. We exploited the role of arts for visualising knowledge acquisition and overcoming barriers between scientific and artistic domains. Thirty students of Grade 5 of the compulsory elementary school (average age: 10.7 years), previously diagnosed with special needs (ADHD and ADD), participated in a three-semester remedial programme of four, 60-90 minutes, after regular instructions. The theoretical foundation of our interdisciplinary pedagogy was the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education model. Intersecting areas of Mathematics and Visual Culture were identified in space and plane geometry and incorporated in collaborative projects. We employed a variety of scientific visualisation techniques for Mathematics instruction (e.g., infographic design and interpretation, modelling of geometric rules and phenomena in 3D) and incorporated in creative tasks. Visual competence was assessed through standardised spatial skills tests and a process-oriented portfolio method, and significant development of visual language use was detected. Improvement in Mathematics was assessed through standardised national tests that revealed impressive growth. This chapter ends with policy implications of the use of arts-based methods to enhance cognitive abilities of students with social, behavioural and learning challenges. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Andrea Kárpáti.},

The analysis dissects psychological resilience’s role as a mediator among digitally literate-conscious kids. The underlying theory underpinning the literature is a social learning theory, which provides the paradigm lens for effectively accessing and evaluating available digital information. This study measures these proposed assumptions using structural equation modeling techniques. Data collection was carried out in structured questionnaires, and the target population was parents of preschool children. The study used a convenience sampling technique to select a sample of parents based on preschool children under five. The results show that digital literacy among preschoolers is directly and positively related to their school readiness, mental well-being, and resilience. Findings suggest that psychological resilience significantly mediates between children’s digital literacy and school readiness. The findings provide valued insight and further directions for policymakers and educators from developing countries. It offers valuable guidance for teachers and parents of preschool children. Findings will encourage them to allow children to use digital gadgets to build and enhance their understanding of digital information. Preschoolers should also receive implicit and explicit training in the practical and fundamental knowledge of digital technologies for their educational use. In theory, this study contributes to the scientific literature by answering how digital literacy and resilience positively impact children’s school readiness and mental well-being. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Even in the STS learning area of the fifth grade, it is stated that digital literacy and self-control are the skills intended to be gained by students. Considering this situation, in addition to the digital literacy and self-control skills, the predictive effects of the STS learning area on the academic achievements of students were investigated in the study. This study, in which the correlational survey method was employed, was carried out with 742 students in the fifth grade. The data were collected with ‘The Science, Technology and Society Learning Area Achievement Test’, The Digital Literacy Scale’, ‘The Self-control Scale for Children’, and ‘The Social Studies Course Motivation Scale’. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis were used in the data analysis. According to the research results, it was found that digital literacy, self-control and course motivation predict the academic achievements of the students in the STS learning area. It was also determined that the predictive effect of these variables on the academic achievement in the STS learning area was in the order of digital literacy, self-control and course motivation. In line with this result, it can be claimed that both skill building and motivation are effective in academic achievement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

Considering the decline in the Indonesian democracy index referring to the release, it was recorded at 5.37, down from the previous 5.44. One of the biggest problems is civil liberties issues on social media. So voter education is essential. Implementing digital leadership is one of the keys to building positive narratives or opinions related to voter education. This research uses qualitative methods with data collection techniques, focus group discussion and documentation, and data analysis techniques using Nvivo 12 Plus as artificial intelligence software. This research found that the KPU and Bawaslu still have several obstacles, such as the absence of a framework, SOPs, modules, minimal budget, and minimal human resources qualifications to conduct voter education in the digital world. Even in terms of infrastructure, both are ready and have adequate tools to produce voter education content. It means that KPU and Bawaslu still need to fulfill the values of digital leadership. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

We used a descriptive qualitative approach with a total of 14 informants, including 10 high school students, two school principals, and two civics teachers at State Junior High School 1 Ogan Komering Ulu and State Junior High School 1 Jakarta. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, observations, and documentation and analyzed later using data condensation, data display, and conclusion drawing. The results of the study confirm that for the studied population: 1) There is support from school principals for the implementation of the Pancasila student profile program, as evidenced by attempts to strengthen teacher competence through workshops and direct supervision at schools. 2) Teachers try to inculcate global diversity values, i.e., those related to social justice, inclusivity, respect, and tolerance in students, such that students are taught to understand and respect all cultures, which is achieved by increased communication and interaction among students belonging to different regions, cultures, and tribes. 3) Students are taught lessons via interesting learning media so that they can internalize the values of Pancasila student profiles with global diversity. The recommendations from this research are headmasters and teachers collaborate to implement the independent curriculum and can provide exemplary behavior by strengthening the Pancasila learning profile concretely and sustainably to form students' multicultural character as expected. © 2023, Association for Social Studies Educa.

	abstract = {There is little consensus about the nature of teachers’ digital competencies in Higher Education. Moreover, existing digital competence frameworks have largely been developed for teachers in secondary education. In response to this, the current study focuses on developing and validating a framework of digital competencies for teachers in Higher Education. First, a review was conducted to determine the state of digital competence research regarding dimensions and definition of digital competence. In a next step, similarities and differences between existing digital competence frameworks were identified. Based on the outcomes of the review and the framework comparison, a framework was developed in an iterative process through expert meetings with policy makers, experts in the field of educational technology, and validated with practitioners. The new framework includes four dimensions of teachers’ digital competencies: (1) Teaching practice, (2) Empowering students for a digital society, (3) Teachers’ digital literacy, and (4) Teachers’ professional development. The resulting Higher Education Digital Competence (HeDiCom) framework will provide guidance and clearer expectations of teachers’ digital competency. Ultimately, improving teachers’ digital competencies will contribute to improving the quality of digital competencies of the students. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {— This work aimed to measure and describe the level of digital competencies from a pedagogical approach in UASLP teachers, validate the theoretical relationship between its dimensions, and identify behavioral patterns among the teachers. This was a quantitative study with a mixed approach with a correlational, cross-sectional, and non-experimental scope. The study sample was 270 professors from a Mexican public university. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, cluster analysis, and non-parametric hypothesis tests were used. The validity of the construct of the proposed instrument was confirmed. The levels of competence measured were found to be convenient, as well as their degree of integration in educational practice. Higher levels of digital skills were found in teachers with fewer years of experience, possibly related to being a digital native. The findings identify two groups of teachers: ICT-Transformative Teachers, who excel in integrating ICT into their teaching practices, and ICT-Reluctant Teachers, which significantly explain the level of competence. ICT-Transformative Teachers demonstrate resistance and difficulties. Additionally, digital teaching competencies are interrelated and partially explain teachers’ capabilities. In conclusion, teachers’ digital competencies should be addressed through a comprehensive training plan, considering the pedagogical approach and contextual elements, like generational aspects. © 2023 IEEE.},

Method: This type of research method is a quantitative method by design pre and post-test non-equivalent control group design. The sample used was 150 students in the Jakarta area who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. Findings: The results of this study prove that the STREAM-based 21st-century learning model can be used as an alternative model that is feasible and effective to use to improve students' digital literacy. Conclusion: The STREAM model can stimulate students' digital literacy where they will be trained to think critically in solving problems and be able to process, assess, analyze and evaluate the digital information they get wisely reinforced by character values. The novelty of this research is that the STREAM model is a development of the STEAM model by adding an R element, namely Religion, which is implemented in the form of character and moral values. So, this model is a unified whole that includes science, technology, religion, engineering, art, and mathematics. Implications for Research and Practice: The results of this study can contribute and provide solutions for education practitioners in order to develop 21st-century learning models that are able to improve students' digital literacy accompanied by good character and moral values.  © 2023 Author(s).},

This kind of writing project aligns with existing learning goals for FYC and facilitates instruction in digital literacy, multimodal, and public writing skills. This article provides a case study of teaching Wikipedia writing to FYC students with the support of the Wiki Education program. Through writing for Wikipedia, my students practiced advanced research and writing skills as well as process steps such as drafting and soliciting feedback from external readers. Through working with the Wiki Education program, students learn digital literacy skills such as markdown and working in sandboxes. I also discuss the challenges of teaching Wikipedia writing to first-year students, especially in larger classes or when teaching more than 1–2 sections at a time. I conclude with advice for implementing a Wikipedia writing project in the first-year composition classroom. © 2023},

They cite Rowsell and Pahl (2011), authors who contributed to the third edition of the Handbook, and who say that “we can no longer focus on alphabetic print as the unit of study in literacy education.” Moving beyond the evolution of multimodal pedagogy, the authors guide their examination of the current roles multimodal and digital literacies play in our current context, then discuss key trends in multimodal pedagogies, including theoretical and conceptual frameworks, equity pedagogy, identity development, and digital literacy standards, application, and assessment.

	abstract = {Previous research about refugee students’ experiences with online learning has focused on the challenges faced by refugee youth, their families, and schools without addressing what strengths families might bring to this type of learning. Further, while previous research has touched upon refugee youth and their families’ substantial digital literacies, these strengths have not been widely applied in support of online learning. In this paper, we advocate for a holistic, asset-based approach to support and develop refugee families’ digital literacy practices for use in online learning experiences. In doing so, we hope to countermand the suggestion that online learning is something refugee families can never benefit from or will only benefit from under an extremely narrow set of conditions. We begin by reviewing previous research about refugee populations and their digital literacies. Then we share Bronfenbrenner’s socio-ecological framework for thinking about shared responsibility in digital and online learning that does not rely on individual students, families, schools, or communities as independent actors. Next, we apply the socio-ecological thinking that we propose to online learning for refugee families across various systems and share theoretical, design, and pedagogical implications. We conclude by offering some implications for research and reiterating the importance of asset framing and shared work in serving refugee and other vulnerable populations well. © 2023, The Online Learning Consortium.

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has inevitably demonstrated the importance of the digital competence of each individual, both personally and socially. Apparently, emergency remote learning has revealed the total unpreparedness of many teachers and students to interact in the online format. Hence, the development of full-scale digital competence is perceived today as a must-have for all actors in the educational process. This goal requires careful and large-scale preparation. It is necessary to understand how modern students interpret the digitalization of education, how they perceive the current level of their digital competence development, and what they see as the reasons for "digital illiteracy"demonstrated by the educational process of the "covid era". This article presents a non-experimental study that aims to evaluate the digital competence of students in higher education and to identify the main obstacles to its efficient deepening and development. Descriptive research was designed using a mixed methodology. We worked with a sample of 431 students. A Framework for Developing and Understanding Digital Competence in Europe, Questionnaire "Problems of Students' Involvement in Digital Socialization", and semi-structured interview were used for data collection. The results show a heterogeneous and rather conditional level of digital knowledge and skills influenced by the region of residence, family economics, cultural backgrounds, and conflicting motivation for the development of digital literacy, as well as the students' access to digital devices and software. The results achieved should be a cause for reflection in universities, in order to implement curricular programs that strengthen this type of skill.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The increased attention of the last decade on translingualism and culturally sustaining practice in English language education is a welcome challenge to the traditionally monolingual approaches to ESOL instruction. However, while there are many equity focused frameworks for language teaching, there often seem to be few concrete examples of how these can be put into practice, on the ground, in multilingual, multicultural learning communities. The goal of this chapter is to contribute to pedagogical and scholarly conversation about translanguaging and language equity and to support curriculum choices that rely on linguistic and cultural input from students. I begin by examining current research on the intersection of anti-racism, translingualism and storytelling, I then present an in practice action research case study on cultural/community stories (often labeled folktales or myths) as content for language learning, and concludes by proposing further ways in which this content might be operationalized in the classroom. The research and experiences described in this chapter demonstrate that traditional stories are one way that educators can approach language variation, encourage the diverse identities of their students and resist the colonial legacy and destructive homogenizing norm of “standard” English. © 2023, Taylor and Francis.},

In order to respond to this objective, the Model for Developing Effective e-Learners (MDEeL) was used. A multigroup analysis with structural equations and a simple quota sample of secondary education (N = 300) and higher education (N = 300) students in Spain were used. The results showed that the influence of teaching support on basic digital skills associated with the use of the Internet as a learning resource was moderated by educational level.

This study used a quantitative approach with ex-post facto research type. The populations in this study were students of the University of Lampung with a sample of 947 taken using simple random sampling. The data collection instrument used was adapted from the Self Rating Scale of Self-Directed Learning (SRSSDL) and Digital Literacy Measurement (DLM). The data collected were analyzed using linear regression. The results showed the positive and significant effect of self-directed learning on the digital literacy level of students, with the contribution of 54.80%, and the rest was influenced by other factors that were not measured in this study. The effect also had a positive direction, which means that the higher the student's self-directed learning score, the better the digital literacy skills will be. © 2022 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

Modern social work management education therefore requires students to gain new critical digital competencies and opportunities for students to acquire these critical skills as part of their academic training in a systematic fashion. This chapter first discusses the new work environments social workers encounter as a result of the transformation of typical social spaces and administrative challenges based on the increased digitalization, informationalization, and hybridization of social work contexts. Next, the paper highlights the respective new professional digital competencies required of social workers as part of their professional toolkit allowing them to (re)gain agency in these transformed social and administrative environments. The chapter then shares experiences from a research methodology module (BA and MA level) offered both in traditional campus/ face-to-face and online formats, offering insights and best practices how students can acquire and discover critical digital literacies in a safe learning space. These include the design of learning environments as experiential experience spaces and respective assessment formats that further enhance the learning of students. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

It is found that university students' existing digital literacy cannot effectively support their mobile language learning practices, which shows that the former has a significant impact on the application level of the latter. The two are significantly related in many elements, but the matching degree between many pairs of related elements is low and the deviation is large: the existing acquisition skill of digital literacy have a negative impact on the satisfaction and usefulness of mobile language learning; Low-level creative skill have a negative impact on the usefulness, convenience and satisfaction of mobile phone language learning. Therefore, measures such as promoting the development of general digital literacy to specialized digital literacy, adopting digital literacy promotion plan that integrate daily contact and training interventions, carrying out teaching activities based on low deviation matching, and using demographic characteristics to adjust digital literacy can improve the level of mobile language learning adoption. © 2023, International Association of Online Engineering.

	abstract = {Background: In Ethiopia and other developing countries, electronic medical record systems and other health information technology are being introduced. However, a small proportion of low-income countries have successfully implemented national health information systems. One cause for this can be the lack of digital literacy among medical practitioners. As a result, this study aimed to assess health professionals’ digital literacy level and associated factors in Northwest Ethiopia. Method: A quantitative cross-sectional study was employed among 423 health professionals working in a teaching and referral hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. We modified and applied the European commission’s framework for digital competency to assess the level of digital literacy among health professionals. We used stratified random sampling with proportional allocation to the size of the departments in the hospital to select study participants. Data were collected using a semi-structured, self-administered, and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive and binary logistic regression analysis techniques were used to describe respondents’ digital literacy level and identify its associated factor, respectively. The odds ratio with 95% CI and value of p were used to assess the strength of the association and statistical significance, respectively. Results: Out of 411 participants, 51.8% (95% CI, 46.9–56.6%) of health professionals had adequate digital literacy. Holding a master’s degree (Adjusted OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.18–3.85), access to digital technology (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.12–3.17), having training in digital technology (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.05–2.59), and having a positive attitude towards digital health technology (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02–2.68) were found to be significant factors associated with health professionals digital literacy level of health professionals. Conclusion: Low level of digital literacy among health professionals was observed, with nearly half (48.2%) of them having poor digital literacy levels. Access to digital technology, training on digital technology, and attitude toward digital health technology were significant factors associated with digital literacy. It is suggested to increase computer accessibility, provide a training program on digital health technology, and promote a positive attitude toward this technology to improve the deployment of health information systems.

The theoretical framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is an approach that connects the knowledge of educators with Information and Communications Technology (ICT), concurrently developing technology-supported pedagogical knowledge and integration of technology into education. The paper aims to investigate educators’ self-assessment of their digital competencies and their implementation in musical activities with preschool children. The respondents are full-time and part-time graduate students of the Early Childhood and Preschool Education study program from faculties of teacher education in Croatia. The obtained results indicate that 91,1 % of respondents didn’t have any formal ICT education while 59,5 % didn’t have any additional type of music education except during their studies. Nevertheless, the greatest knowledge participants have shown on the competencies for using digital tools (CFUDT) scale succeeded by a technological knowledge (TK) scale of the adapted TPACK-TCCMA survey, thus the respondents rated their digital and ICT competencies exceedingly high unlike music and pedagogical competencies. Considering the results obtained, it can be concluded that additional attention should be given to the development of digital, music, and pedagogical competencies during studies that will be applicable in both music and other areas of education. © 2022 by the authors.},

We believe that the level of digital skills may be a key to understanding their attitude. A study was conducted at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland. The respondents assessed, amongst other items, the level of their own digital skills. Based on this assessment, three groups of students with different skill levels were distinguished. Further analyses showed that students with different level of digital skills vary according to their own experiences in collaborative online learning, but not in terms of views on the phenomenon, technologies used, or computer hardware. Most differences are between the low and high skill groups. However, they are also present between the low and average, and the average and high skill groups. These results contribute to the discussion on the need to individualise the teaching and learning process and highlight the roles of digital competence development for all participants in the learning process. © The Authors.},

As an educator in a college of education, the author have mistaken students not having hidden digital literacies for defiance and their presence as compliance without challenging the underlying assumptions these narratives create. Historically, literacy has been narrowly defined as reading and writing, and these literacy skills were largely accessible only to social elites-typically White, landowning males.

It has become a key element in teaching and learning across the different educational stages that has been addressed since the last decade of the twentieth century within the field of open, distance, and digital education. The literature so far has not agreed on a common definition, but multiple international, national, and even local, frameworks exist to foster digital literacy and to evaluate and certificate it, especially with a focus on educators and students in different educational levels, but also with the citizen perspective. These frameworks are reviewed in this chapter, along with the evolution and conceptualization of digital literacy and some strategies to foster digital literacy in different educational sectors, with a focus on the educator as a key player in this fostering action. The most remarkable challenges for developing digital literacy for teaching and learning include the same conception of digital literacy, which is multiple and situated, the digital divide and the actual consideration of digital literacy as a social practice. Being digital literacy a transversal competency nowadays, clear implications for education can be drawn, such as reshaping organizations to the digital conditions, thinking on digital literacy as a collective effort, and enriching the global discourse through diversity in debates. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Learning to Learn is a theoretical position linked to constructivist theories of learning; has gained strength by being applied in various educational contexts, where educators adopt and internalize the importance of the teaching-learning process, as a means to develop the skills and abilities that lead the learner to critical, autonomous and flexible thinking, in addition to other skills. requirements for professional practice. This position is closely linked to epistemological, methodological, procedural, attitudinal aspects and the development of digital skills. By virtue of the above, the article aims to analyze the relationship between the conceptual elements of Learning to Learn with the formation of digital skills. To achieve this purpose, the study obtained a group of four hundred and thirty-two students (432), applying an associative-predictive design, using the questionnaires to measure variables; the evaluation questionnaire of the Learning to Learn competence and the questionnaire of the Digital Competence of Higher Education Students (CDAES). Once the data was analyzed, it was found that the association between these variables is low (r = .226) and the dimensions that best predict digital skills are the cognitive and metacognitive factors. It is concluded that, in order to develop digital skills adequately, it is necessary to promote cognitive and metacognitive strategies as part of the development of the Learning to Learn competence of students. © 2022, Universidad del Zulia.

However, digital literacy studies for administrative staff seem to be neglected in the current literature. This article examines the impact of higher education administrative staff’s digital literacy on their intention to use digital technologies while performing their tasks. For this purpose, a conceptual model consisting of effort expectancy and performance expectancy structures based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and expanded with the digital literacy dimension has been created. Data were collected from 158 participants who were administrative staff of two higher education institutions in Türkiye to evaluate the theoretical model. The data were analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The findings revealed the relationship between the digital literacy skills of higher education administrative staff and their intention to use digital technology. According to the results, digital literacy has a direct effect on effort expectancy but not on performance expectancy. Also, contrary to our expectations, digital literacy does not directly affect the intention to use. However, digital literacy affects the intention to use digital technology through effort expectancy and performance expectancy. In higher education, personnel with low digital literacy skills should be identified and in-service training should be provided. This is one of the first studies to address the impact of digital literacy on technology acceptance by administrative staff working in higher education. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The importance of media literacy is explained, which leads to a discussion of how media literacy evolved into digital media literacy due to the transformation of media in the last 2 decades, a critical concept for journalism students to understand. One critical issue in journalism education is teaching ways to keep communication channels open that will allow the public to access correct, reliable news and information and stand against initiatives that will prevent the public from being informed. Using current technological innovations at all stages of journalism education brings several advantages to journalism students. In Turkey, journalism education focused on print media, radio, and television journalism until the mid-2000s. Apart from a few innovative courses such as internet journalism or virtual journalism, the approach of journalism education is oriented to employment in traditional media, focusing on newspapers and television. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs or TIC) represent not only an extension of humans but pervasive environments in which all individuals move. However, even today, there is a gap between users in relation to age: the over-65s in Europe and Italy, for example, present difficulties in the use of digital tools and therefore strong disparities in relation to access to Internet and related resources and opportunities. This means that the elderlies are in serious risk to social exclusion and marginalization in the knowledge society, in which technological artifacts are instead crucial for social inclusion. Therefore, the essay aims to reflect on these issues through a sociological lens, with references to digital literacy and media education as possible alternatives, and social-relational interventions to reduce digital disengagement and the consequent digital divide. Thus, the paper proposes the intergenerational digital social innovation perspective that, by activating bottom-up digital-oriented welfare policies, promotes learning in old age. In fact, this is a determining factor in the design of educational spaces co-constructed together with the older people. © 2023, Padova University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Digital competence has gained a strong prominence in the educational context, being one of the key competencies that teachers must master in today's society. Although most models and frameworks focus on the pre-university level, there is a growing interest in knowing the state of digital competencies of university teachers, that is, the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for a teacher to make effective use of technologies. The aim of this research is to present a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus, to identify, analyze and classify the published articles between 2000 and 2021 on digital competences, and thus find and improve the research being done on digital skills and future avenues of teachers in the university context. The SciMAT software is used in the analysis. The initial search reveals more than 343 articles in English, of which 152 are duplicates and 135 are not related to the topic of study. After this filtering, 56 articles are obtained and analyzed in depth. The results reveal a predominance of research that focuses on analyzing teachers' self-assessment and reflection of their digital competencies. Teachers recognize that they have a low or medium–low digital competence, as well as the absence of certain competencies, especially those related to the evaluation of educational practice. Despite the multiple studies that address this issue, it is necessary to continue improving research in this area, deepening the assessment of teachers' digital competencies and design, on this basis, more practical and personalized training programs that respond to the needs of teachers in the digital era. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This paper examines the triangulation of Digital Literacy (DL), psychological well-being, and effectiveness of remote teaching and learning during the pandemic. Survey responses collected from 518 schoolteachers in Sri Lanka are analyzed with Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method. Results indicate that Remote Education (RE) has twisted a stressful life for educators. DL negatively affects the psychological well-being of the teacher. The effectiveness of teaching and learning and teacher engagement depends upon their DL level. Educators’ stress and depression status mediate the outcome of remote teaching and learning mode. Moreover, digital skills count more than the accumulated teaching experience. We emphasize the adaptive role of the teacher for sustainable digital education. The results indicate that augmented education success could be obtained by investing in digital competence.

	abstract = {Various blended learning models have been developed, but none of them have focused on support systems to improve the digital literacy of preservice teachers. This study aims to produce a prototype of a blended learning support system that can improve the digital literacy of preservice teachers. This type of research is research and development using a 4D model. This research was conducted at Universitas Negeri Padang and started with a needs analysis of 168 students to develop a blended learning prototype. The prototype was tested on six experts, six lecturers, and six students in the limited test and 50 students at the dissemination stage. The data collection instrument used observation and questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis. The results show that the validity of the blended learning support system to improve the digital literacy of preservice teachers was in the very valid category. All indicators from the experts were higher than indicators from the lecturers. Although each support system was assessed differently by the experts and the lecturers, overall the digital literacy components in each support system were declared valid. The results of this study contribute to the development of digital literacy for preservice teachers by integrating digital literacy skills into a blended learning support system that includes lesson plans, content, and activities on the LMS as well as digital literacy-based assessments. © 2022, Grand Canyon University.

	abstract = {For some years, teachers’ digital skills have been critical to the educational process; nevertheless, with the health catastrophe released by Covid-19, they have become critical. So, the purpose of this study was to examine and quantify the degree of digital literacy among instructors of Regular Basic Education at UGEL Tacna. The study used a hybrid quantitative-qualitative methodology and was mostly descriptive in nature. There were 1,329 teachers in the population and sample. The questionnaire and the interview were employed as instruments. The findings suggest that 49.89% teachers had a high degree of digital competence, while 12.19% have a basic level, which includes instructors at the elementary, primary, and secondary levels. Instructors get knowledge about web 2.0 technologies and their utility and application via interviews; it is advised that teachers enhance cognitive digital abilities. That is, the investigative skills geared toward the virtual environment and their development in pupils. It concludes by identifying the most critical training needs associated with the cognitive digital domain's medium-low level, establishing the necessity of developing a strengthening plan for cognitive digital skills that have not been developed satisfactorily, particularly in the creation of digital educational materials and related educational projects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In fact, in the industrial revolution 4.0 era, students are agents of change to have good digital literacy skills in facing multidimensional challenges and prospects in the future. This research itself focuses on the influence of the existence of digital literacy on Indonesian language skills. Ten Respondents of Institut Technology of Sepuluh Nopember 2021 Urban and Regional Planning Students were sampled to prove this through quantitative research using survey methods and user tests. Respondents with a high duration of using social media to represent digital literacy show high Indonesian language proficiency test results. Meanwhile, respondents with a reasonable period of social media use showed more volatile results due to the influence of several other variables. Overall, a high level of digital literacy can improve one's Indonesian language skills. From this, it can be seen that digital literacy among students is critical in the future, especially in enhancing their Indonesian language skills. © 2022, North American Business Press.

	abstract = {Introduction: Technology in education, including language learning, is on the rise. Digital competency is essential for teachers to effectively integrate technology and enhance language teaching. It enables access to authentic materials, interactive exercises, and collaboration opportunities. However, integrating technology poses challenges for teachers. Objective: This empirical research aimed to investigate the impact of digital competency on language learning outcomes in the context of “smart education,” which incorporates sustainable practices and digital technologies in the language classroom. Methods: The study adopted a quantitative approach to collect and analyze data. The sample population for the study comprised of 344 language teachers at various language schools in a metropolitan city. The data collection carried out with a digital competency questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate technique, i.e., structural equation modeling. Findings: The study found that digital competency positively correlated with language proficiency outcomes. Participants with higher levels of digital competency achieved better language learning outcomes compared to those with lower levels of digital competency. Additionally, the study found that incorporating sustainable practices, such as digitalized learning materials and virtual classrooms, positively contributed to language learning outcomes. The findings of this study suggest that digital competency plays a vital role in language learning outcomes in the context of “smart education.” Discussion & Recommendation: Teachers should consider incorporating digital tools and sustainable practices into their language teaching to enhance language learning outcomes. The study recommends that language educators should focus on developing digital competency and integrating sustainable practices into their language classroom to promote effective language learning.

This can present many challenges, including lacking teacher professional development, uneven digital infrastructure across school districts or unequal access to digital media among students. In this article, I focus on a different challenge that stems from differing definitions of digital literacy among educational researchers, teachers, and educational policy makers and the tensions that can arise from these differences for teachers who are tasked with developing learners’ digital literacy. Specifically, I discuss how I have merged a curricular mandate for a skills-heavy digital literacy policy with my theoretical conviction of literacy as social practice in my teaching of a tertiary course on digital literacy. To do so, I first critically examine Singapore’s recent digital literacy curriculum reform with reference to a larger divide between conceptualizations of digital literacy as technical, decontextualized skills related to employability on the one hand and as social practice rooted in students’ lived experiences on the other. Second, I discuss my efforts at combining these two perspectives in teaching digital media literacy, highlighting how we can foster digital ‘skills’ and critical engagement with digital media while providing space for playful and creative communicative practice. © 2022 TESOL International Association.},

	abstract = {Introduction: It is estimated that around 50% of cancer patients require Radiotherapy (RT) at some point during their treatment, hence Therapeutic Radiographers/Radiation Therapists (TR/RTTs) have a key role to play in patient management. It is essential for TR/RTTs to keep abreast with new technologies and continuously develop the digital skills necessary for safe RT practice. The RT profession and education is not regulated at European Union level, which leads to heterogeneity in the skills developed and practised among countries. This study aimed to explore the white and grey literature to collate data on the relevant digital skills required for TR/RTTs practice. Methods: An exhaustive systematic search was conducted to identify literature discussing digital skills of TR/RTTs; relevant grey literature was also identified. A thematic analysis was performed to identify and organise these skills into themes and sub-themes. Results: 195 digital skills were identified, organised in 35 sub-themes and grouped into six main themes: (i) Transversal Digital Skills, (ii) RT Planning Image, (iii) RT Treatment Planning, (iv) RT Treatment Administration, (v) Quality, Safety and Risk Management, and (vi) Management, Education and Research. Conclusion: This list can be used as a reference to close current gaps in knowledge or skills of TR/RTTs while anticipating future needs regarding the rapid development of new technologies (such as Artificial Intelligence or Big Data). Implications for practice: It is imperative to align education with current and future RT practice to ensure that all RT patients receive the best care. Filling the gaps in TR/RTTs skill sets will improve current practice and provide TR/RTTs with the support needed to develop more advanced skills. © 2022 The Authors},

The results of the characterization show that 77% of teachers are in the highest categories of the checkIn (B2-49% and C1 28%), from this the idea of objectively evaluating their performance arises, considering that the applied instrument is self-diagnostic. A semi-structured interview was designed to compare the results in the next phase of the project.  © 2022 ACM.},

A demographic analysis of the participants enrolled on the cancer genomics MOOC revealed a heterogeneous range of learner stakeholders with different educational and professional backgrounds, including learners pursuing higher education, patients and family members of those with cancer, and current and past health care professionals. From learner feedback in the initial runs of the course the authors discovered the requirement to develop additional digital literacy education. The authors chose to embed this digital literacy education as a strand throughout the 6 weeks of the course and mainly focus on teaching learners how to evaluate cancer-related online resources, including websites and scientific publications. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group.},

The results show how five dedicated teachers, without a special interest in digital tools, started using tablets in preschool as a learning tool to achieve the goals in the curriculum regarding communication. The experiment model used in the study is based on design-oriented theories. The design-based experiment provided an opportunity for in-depth reflection among the teachers and a meeting place for collegial learning processes, which can in turn lead to preschool development. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Given that they play a crucial role in helping persons outside formal education to navigate the digital world, these organizations have the potential to be key players in addressing problematic information. These institutions could provide critical support in this area since they teach people to use information and communication technologies and how to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information effectively and efficiently. This poster explored how seven digital literacy curricula for adults address problematic information. We found problematic information related lessons were siloed from other lessons on social media or online searching, and these curricula do not use current best practices for evaluating information but rely on older information literacy models.

	abstract = {Digital systems are increasingly becoming central to the running of contemporary schools. A range of digital tools are also adopted by teachers to facilitate face to face teaching and learning and more recently to accommodate remote schooling. Similarly, digital technologies lie at the heart of how students support their learning but also interact with peers. These digital practices raise questions in relation to teachers’ own critical digital literacies as well as their role in developing students’ critical digital literacies. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study that aimed to develop an understanding of teachers’ current experiences and future needs relating to critical digital literacies within school contexts. Drawing on empirical data collected during focus group interviews with primary and secondary school teachers in Finland, Italy, Spain and the UK this paper looks at teachers’ perceptions of critical digital literacies and explores whether and how these are manifested in their practices. Findings revealed that different dimensions of critical digital literacies were more prevalent for each national group and highlighted the disjuncture between how Critical digital literacies (CDL) is defined and perceived in academic research with a stronger emphasis on the “critical” and between the more “twenty-first century skills” oriented policy agendas and curricula which inform teachers’ practice. The paper goes on to discuss the implications of these findings and identifies gaps in relation to teachers’ understandings of critical digital literacies. Last, it offers original insights for future policymaking, research and practice regarding the challenges of supporting teachers with developing critical digital literacies. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: To provide high-quality education and remain innovative, thus contributing to sustainable development goals, educational institutions use digital tools and implement ICT in the teaching process. In addition to providing technical resources, it requires the appropriate education of teachers who should have the appropriate knowledge and skills to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by ICT. Objectives: The main objective of this article is to identify the current state of ICT knowledge and skills of university professors and high school teachers and to establish if there exists a relationship between their digital competencies and teaching experience. We strive to discover areas where digital competencies are already relatively high and ICT knowledge and skills gaps. Methods/Approach: Survey was conducted on a sample of university and secondary school professors who were asked to estimate their perceived level of knowledge and skills in various ICT domains. Results: The results of our research show that the total self-assessed level of competence is intermediate, with slightly higher values for ICT knowledge than for ICT skills. The results vary depending on the different subcategories of competencies and the years of respondents' teaching experience. Conclusions: Our research findings, which revealed variations and gaps in digital knowledge and skills among professors and teachers, may have significant policy implications for policymakers and educators committed to ensuring quality education.  © 2022 BoÅ1/4ena Pera et al., published by Sciendo.},

It focuses on the undergraduate chemistry student, primarily chemistry majors, from the vantage point of a full-time practitioner rather than an expert in digital literacy or education theory. A surprisingly difficult digital literacy task in chemistry is searching for information on particular chemical compounds or reactions. Tools like ChemSpider make finding chemical information much easier for students and researchers and are an important part of digital literacy in chemistry. Having explored the challenge that chemical representations present for digital literacy in chemistry, the author would like to turn to some of the opportunities digital literacy could provide chemistry education, particularly in the undergraduate context. In particular, one opportunity is the increased use of electronic lab notebooks, digital posters, and student-generated video, which have the potential to change the way students and faculty create and consume chemical information. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Data science is becoming increasingly prominent in the medical profession, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting additional challenges and opportunities for medical education. We retrospectively appraised the existing biomedical informatics (BMI) and biostatistics courses taught to students enrolled in a six-year medical program. Methods. An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among 121 students in their fourth year, with regard to the courses they previously attended, in contrast with the ongoing emergency medicine (EM) course during the first semester of the academic year 2020–2021, when all activities went online. The questionnaire included opinion items about courses and self-assessed knowledge, and questions probing into the respondents’ familiarity with the basics of data science. Results. Appreciation of the EM course was high, with a median (IQR) score of 9 (7–10) on a scale from 1 to 10. The overall scores for the BMI and biostatistics were 7 (5–9) and 8 (5–9), respectively. These latter scores were strongly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient R = 0.869, p < 0.001). We found no correlation between measured and self-assessed knowledge of data science (R = 0.107, p = 0.246), but the latter was fairly and significantly correlated with the perceived usefulness of the courses. Conclusions. The keystone of this different perception of EM versus data science was the courses’ apparent value to the medical profession. The following conclusions could be drawn: (a) objective assessments of residual knowledge of the basics of data science do not necessarily correlate with the students’ subjective appraisal and opinion of the field or courses; (b) medical students need to see the explicit connection between interdisciplinary or complementary courses and the medical profession; and (c) courses on information technology and data science would better suit a distributed approach across the medical curriculum. © 2022 by the authors.},

The thematic content analysis of the data was based on core principles of early childhood pedagogy, multiliteracies and professional development theories. It revealed that, from this teacher’s perspective, the application of digital literacy practices has both enhanced and challenged her pedagogy. Moreover, the analysis showed that her innovative practices combine functional professional learning with attitudinal dispositions such as professionalism, professional identity, resilience and commitment. Overall, our research highlights the importance of combining both functional and attitudinal dimensions in professional development initiatives aiming to enhance renewed integration of digital literacy practices in early childhood education. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

For constructing digital process and Business Analytics models, Treasurers need digital construction skills including using specialist software. While these skills are completely different from typical other skills in business studies and not all students seem to be interested in constructing digital data- driven problem solutions an adjusted self- learning strategy seems to be required to learn these competencies. For Business Analytics construction skills a constructive learning model for Treasury seems to be adequate. To develop this the demand for digital skills is analyzed here using important business snapshots of leading companies and a large number of job offers. Based on this demand and established learning theories, a self- directed constructive learning model is developed and applied for Treasury to show how to teach students to enable them to solve complex digital problems by themselves. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2023.

However, there is ongoing debate regarding the evidence of its impact on teaching and learning in physical education. With increasing use in education, digitally competent teachers are essential to the success of its integration. The primary aim of this study was to explore perceived teacher competency levels in applying digital technology to the physical education classroom. Teachers perceived significantly low competency levels in relation to digital technology in physical education. This was a result of both personal and school hindrances which teachers identified as impeding the integration of digital technology in their physical education classes. Drawing on a holistic view of the dichotomy of pedagogy and technology, we suggest that this relationship is more complex than the one stated in most digital competence frameworks, therefore a narrow understanding of teacher digital competency in physical education. © 2022 The Author(s).

In this day and age, traditional literacy proves inadequate and digital literacy has become a necessity within the education sector. The COVID-19 pandemic and the intensification of the industrial revolution mean that education has rapidly shifted online. It has, therefore, become important to understand the challenges faced in the move to online teaching and learning in Malaysia, especially in this post-pandemic era. This chapter discusses the concept of digital literacy, as well as various motivating factors for educators and learners to make the migration from traditional to online teaching and learning. These challenges include the lack of coherent policymaking both at the national and institute levels, the digital divide that exists, the readiness of teachers and students in making the transition, the concern for special needs education and, finally, security concerns involved.

Not only did the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impact the necessity of technology in our daily lives, but also reduced the availability of digital skills programmes. This study aimed to explore perceived facilitators and barriers of a digital skills programme that was delivered remotely (online) and to reflect on this form of training as a possible alternative to traditional face-to-face models. Methods: Individual interviews were carried out with programme participants and the programme instructor. Results: Two themes were generated from this data: (a) Creating a unique learning environment; and (b) Encouraging further learning. Discussion: Barriers to digital delivery were evident, however, the individual and personalized delivery empowered participants within their own learning, supporting individuals to learn skills relevant to them and to continue their digital learning journey.

	abstract = {Taking courses by continuing education (CE) providers is one of the main ways for adults to learning digital skills. CE is provided in either face-to-face (F2F) or online distance learning (ODL) mode. While F2F courses are natural and well-understood, ODL is flexible and less expensive. However, ODL lacks the natural teacher-student and student-student interaction. It is important to find out the factors that affect the adult learner’s preferred learning mode for gaining digital skills. This study examined these factors by modifying the Unified Theory Of Acceptance And Use Of Technology (UTAUT). The authors modified the UTAUT by adding the reputation of the provider (RP) and price perception (PP) as moderators. The data from an online survey involving 125 adult learners was analyzed using Smart PLS 3.0. It was found that among the four original UTAUT constructs, social influence is not related to the attitude towards the preferred learning mode. Furthermore, RP has a significant moderation effect on the Performance Expectancy, and Effort Expectancy. Lastly, PP affects the Facilitating Conditions. The implication for CE providers is that they should try to maintain a good reputation for their CE courses. In particular, for MOOC platforms, the providers should have more courses that are created by professional bodies or universities. Interestingly, the adult learners perceive the price as an indicator of facilitating conditions. Hence, the provider should charge their courses that reflect the quality of the infrastructure of, and the support for, the technologies used in delivering those courses.

The research was carried out in the eleventh grade of SMA Negeri Plus Riau in the even semester of the 2021/2022 academic year. This research is quasi-experimental, using a closed questionnaire with 4 Linkert scales. The research parameter is students’ digital literacy with eight indicators: Functional Skills and Beyond, Creativity, Collaboration, Communication, The Ability to Find and Select Information, Critical Thinking and Evaluation, Cultural and Social Understanding, and E-Safety. Data were obtained using the Linkert scale and converted into Value (N). Value every aspect is the score obtained from the answer indicators that are checked (considered the most appropriate) and divided by the maximum score multiplied by 100. The average value of each aspect is obtained from the total value of each indicator divided by the number of indicators, then analyzed descriptively and qualitatively. Digital literacy students in the control class got an average score of 77.5 (good category) and 85.25 in the experimental class (very good category). Of the eight indicators, the highest digital literacy indicator in the control and experimental classes is creativity, with scores of 85 and 88, respectively. The E-Safety indicator scores 85 and 90. The lowest score was the Critical Thinking and Evaluation indicator, in the control and experimental classes, with a 75, categorized as good.

Its use in educational contexts and processes seeks to integrate technology and pedagogy. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the level of Digital Teaching Competencies (DTCs) possessed by basic education (BE) teachers in different Peruvian schools and their comparison by competency area, considering sociodemographic factors. The research responds to a quantitative methodological approach. A non-experimental design of a comparative descriptive type was used, and a non-probabilistic purposeful sampling was applied. A total of 3,142 BE teachers participated in the study, including the educational levels of preschool (0–5 years), primary school (6–11 years), and Secondary school (12–16 years), belonging to public institutions located in rural and urban areas of the province of Arequipa (Peru). The instrument developed in the European Framework of Digital Competence, DigCompEdu Check-In, was applied. This instrument aimed to measure teachers’ level of competence in the digital domain. The main results show that a more significant number of teachers present an Integrator competence level (B1), followed by the Expert level (B2), and the Explorer level (A2). Furthermore, low percentages are observed in the most advanced leadership levels, Leader (C1) and Pioneer (C2), in the use of ICTs. The results obtained suggest implementing new strategies to improve DTCs. Based on critical conceptions, technology constitutes an essential tool for education in the twenty first century.

However, as not everyone can rely on this kind of informal help, many older adults are at risk of being unwillingly left without digital support and necessary digital skills. In this article, we examine non-formal digital support and peer tutoring as a way to promote digital and social inclusion through the acquisition of necessary digital skills. First, we ask: (a) What is peer tutoring, in the field of digital training, from the peer tutors’ point of view? Then, based on the first research question, we further ask (b) what are the key characteristics of peer tutoring in relation to other forms of digital support? Our thematic analysis is based on semi-structured interviews (n = 21) conducted in Central Finland in 2022 with peer tutors aged between 63 and 84. Peer tutors offered individual guidance by appointment and also supported their peers in group-based settings. Based on our study, we argue that from the peer tutors’ point of view, being a peer entails sharing an age group or a similar life situation and provides an opportunity for side-by-side learning. Although every encounter as a peer tutor is different and the spectrum of digital support is wide, these encounters share specific key characteristics, such as the experience of equality between the tutor and the tutee that distinguishes non-formal peer support from formal and informal learning. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).},

The project started by considering both countries' national strategies for Industry 4.0 (MAKE-in India and Made Smarter, UK) to identify those areas marked as strategically critical and mapping them onto existing engineering curriculums across undergraduate engineering degrees. Based on local industry partners with clearly defined ‘digitalization’ opportunities, four industrial case studies were selected and reproduced inside both University labs in the form of student projects that were made available to all final year mechanical engineering students at both institutions. The resulting pilot projects exhibited the potential to expose undergraduate students to engineering concepts and techniques not currently covered in the taught curriculums, while offering industry a ‘soft landing’ on the use of Industry 4.0 tools which have not yet been embraced, mainly due to the lack of qualified personnel or access to specific technology skillsets, such as 3D printing, Augmented Reality and Digital Twins. © 2022 The Authors},

The implementation of literacy and the development of necessary technological skills in students form a key part of digital inclusion, which is why research has been originated with the purpose of diagnosing both basic skills and digital literacy to determine, among others, the existence of gaps. The objective of this study is focused on determining the most competent instruments in the diagnosis of skills, for which, as a Method, a systematic search and review of the literature has been carried out, linked to instruments for measuring competences and digital literacy, to identify categories, level of knowledge and skills to function safely in the virtual space. The results delimited 24 publications considered in the systematic review, whose analysis considered the design, validation and application of a competency diagnosis instrument, including the comparison of the models of consultations carried out, to collect the most relevant indicators. The conclusions indicate that the studies carried out in the classroom are slow, but effective, to manage and transfer an objective vision of the diagnosis, but the cost and time justify carrying out self-applied surveys, self-reports and self-assessments, just as plausible, making it possible to deploy numerous students. questions, problems and developments, on a wide range of digital skills in a short time and online. © 2022 Interciencia Association.

	abstract = {This study examines digital competency (DigComp) as a crucial component of twenty-first century teachers. It investigates pre-service teachers’ level of DigComp from their perspective, and whether they felt their preparation programme qualified them for digital education. One hundred forty student teachers in their final year of majoring in either art education or kindergarten at a public university in Saudi Arabia participated. Data was collected via an online survey that included five DigComp areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving. Significant differences were found between the two groups: the communication and collaboration domain had the highest mean in both groups (152.47+19.39; 139.40+ 17.79); while the safety domain had the lowest mean score in both groups (16.48+2.62; 15.06+3.35). Results showed that 77.1% of preservice teachers rated their DigComp as excellent and 22.9% rated it as moderate. The results further revealed that the pre-service teacher programme was average (65.04%) in qualifying pre-service teachers to integrate technology into their future teaching practices. The results of this study highlight the necessity to evaluate pre-service teacher programmes for suitability to produce instructors who possess the cognitive, teaching, and digital competencies required in the era of technology. © 2023 International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology.

UNESCO's study of the digital literacy framework found that in general digital literacy competencies include three components, namely knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Digital literacy is the ability of students related to activities to access and process information related to learning so that it becomes very important in today's developments. Inquiry is learning by learning for students to be active in learning to solve problems, topics, or issues using information sources. In the world of education, in order to improve digital literacy skills, the application of the Nature of Science (NoS) within guided inquiry-based learning approach so that students can solve problems with the teacher still acting as a mentor during the learning process and the NoS component as a supporter of the integration of technology with the nature of science.

Sudden governmental movement control directives prohibited the gentle easing of students into online learning; and disregarded individual learning preferences. Despite that, it is still vital to understand student preferences to facilitate better adaptation and coping with online or blended learning courses. Therefore, a correlational study was designed to investigate preferences for online learning (POL) based on academic self-efficacy (ASE), academic procrastination (AP), and digital literacy (DL) levels. A total of 272 responses were analysed. Respondents were full-time undergraduates aged between 18 to 26 years (M = 20.8, SD = 1.38). Most were females (n=209, 76.5%) and had prior online learning experience (n = 221, 81.3%). The relationship between variables and group differences such as gender and prior experience were examined. Results showed all three study variables were related to POL in the anticipated direction. However, only DL was a significant predictor of POL. Males perceived higher levels of ASE and DL. Students with prior experience had a significantly higher POL. Findings implied that DL and prior experience were important factors in accepting online learning. Therefore, this study calls for a systematic approach to develop ICT skills and encourage exposure to short online classes before enrolment into tertiary education.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that national-level initiatives to equip medical students with relevant digital competencies carry many benefits. Yet, few countries have outlined such competencies for clinical practice in the core medical school curriculum. This paper identifies current training gaps at the national level in digital competencies needed by students in the formal curricula of all three medical schools in Singapore from the perspectives of clinical educators and institutional leaders. It bears implications for countries that intend to implement standardized learning objectives for training in these digital competencies. Findings were drawn from in-depth interviews with 19 clinical educators and leaders of local medical schools. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling. Data were interpreted using qualitative thematic analysis. Thirteen of the participants were clinical educators while 6 were deans or vice deans of education from one of the three medical schools in Singapore. While the schools have introduced some relevant courses, they are not standardized nationally. Moreover, the school’s niche areas have not been leveraged upon for training in digital competencies. Participants across all schools acknowledged that more formal training is needed in digital health, data management, and applying the principles of digital technologies. Participants also noted that the healthcare needs of the population, patient safety, and safe procedures in the utilisation of digital healthcare technologies should be prioritized when determining the competencies needed by students. Additionally, participants highlighted the need for stronger collaboration among medical schools, and for a stronger link between current curriculum and clinical practice. The findings highlighted the need for better collaboration among medical schools in the sharing of educational resources and expertise. Furthermore, stronger collaborations with professional bodies and the healthcare system should be established to ensure that the goals and outcomes of medical education and the healthcare system are aligned. © 2023 The Author(s).

As a result of the development of new teaching and learning tools, an increasing number of students are acquiring knowledge on the Internet-connected to the Internet. Therefore, all citizens must develop digital literacy as a lifelong learning skill. Studies have been conducted on students' digital skills in higher education institutions. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the skills of college students. The participants were students from a university in the Kazan region of Russia who volunteered to participate. Three hundred and eighty students completed the questionnaire online. The scale consists of a total of 25 questions and six dimensions. Since our independent variables are binary values, we applied the Bayesian t-test. We obtained the values of the Bayes factor (BF10) for each dimension and the total scale. In general, students' digital skills are well-developed. However, it was found that creating and using digital information requires fewer skills than in other areas. The hypothesis that there is no difference based on student gender was supported to a higher degree but not to a very high degree. The hypothesis that there is no difference based on students' fields of study was supported to a greater extent, but only to a moderate extent. © 2023 by authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas.},

In this paper, we first used technical methods to determine 20 key indicators that constitute digital literacy, and made a 7-point Likert scale, and distributed and collected 711 questionnaires. Among the valid 664-point questionnaires, we used r language to visualize and analyze the data such as density distribution, heat map, and histogram, which initially revealed the pattern behind the survey data and laid the foundation for the next step of principal component analysis, factor analysis, and regression analysis.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the urgent need to develop innovative pedagogies that build upon and enhance the digital literacies and representational practices of culturally and linguistically diverse youth from refugee backgrounds. In Canadian high schools, this population of students enter school with varying levels of literacy in their first language(s), as well as potentially difficult experiences due to their forced migration. For many, learning English, may become a formidable challenge. A growing corpus of case studies is beginning to show how pedagogies that draw on youths’ everyday meaning making, including their digital literacies, can effectively engage English learners in academic learning. In this qualitative, ethnographic case study involving nine youth in an English language learning classroom, we addressed the question: What is the potential for digital storytelling to draw from the fuller context of the lives and literacies of youth from refugee backgrounds to enable more autonomous language learning and identity affirmation? Our study is informed by interrelated conceptual frameworks: learner autonomy; investment in language and literacy learning; and digital literacies. Using thematic and multimodal/visual analysis, data were collaboratively coded to identify four interweaving themes: 1) use of multimodal meaning making to communicate complex, critical understandings; 2) emergence of digital literacies; 3) challenges of communicating in digital spaces; and 4) investment in identity affirmation in language learning. Implications focus on how digital storytelling as an innovative pedagogy has the potential to create space within the curriculum for stories that have deep meaning for learners. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 brought several new challenges for the students and lecturers, particularly in higher education. The conventional physical classroom was almost instantly pushed into a new environment: a remote session class. And this lecturing paradigm shift occurred, necessarily, in a short period of time. The lecturing players suffered the pressure of using different learning tools and methodologies while exposing themselves to, in most part of cases, unexpected cybersecurity threats. The purpose of this article is to clarify all the new menaces that arose during this period. Also, to understand the level of exposure and impacts on the lecturer and student to this quick but necessary paradigm shift. Methodologically: two focus groups were undertook to capture representations of students about uses of computer technology; differences in exposure to threats before and during the pandemic and impacts on society; student’s needs regarding the topic and suggestions about strategies for increasing overall knowledge about it. Answers were treated recurring to software webQDA®—Qualitative Data Analysis Software for analysis of qualitative data. Results depict the exposure to cybersecurity issues and some level of knowledge about them, inducing preventive practices when using informatics technology. Sense of increasing insecurity in society is associated with the statement of increasing activity regarding cybercrime, giving way to the assumption of the need of awareness and knowledge of general public regarding this issues, and rise suggestions on teaching approaches directed to the subject. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In preliminary work towards these goals, I have developed a theoretical frame for this work, and conducted one initial study evaluating digital storytelling for digital literacy through a web-based storytelling system. In future work I intend to conduct, I will further evaluate digital storytelling's effectiveness for this audience through a new Microsoft Word plugin.

	abstract = {Compatible with global sustainable development report, 2016 edition, and vision 2030, Saudi Arabia recognized the importance of technology in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper aims to measure the self-perception of digital skills among students in Saudi Arabia’s higher education system to understand how they were influenced before and amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, we started a project to study the self-perception of digital skills among Saudi Arabia university students (group A). A total of 469 students participated in this research. The validity and reliability of the employed scale were tested with first-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The differences between the two groups (before and amid the pandemic) were tested through the Mann–Whitney U test. The results for group A (N = 232 students) showed a higher self-perception of their digital skills. In March 2020, amid the pandemic, Saudi Arabia closed and shifted to technology-based teaching like many other countries worldwide. After students’ return to universities in 2021, an evaluation of how the students perceived their own digital skills was again conducted (group B). The results for group B (N = 237 students) demonstrated a lower level of confidence in their own digital abilities. Comparing two groups (A and B), after the educational course was administered, group A (prior to COVID-19) had greater self-perceptions of digital skills than group B (amid COVID-19). Students’ perceptions of their own digital skills have been negatively impacted as a result of the pandemic situation caused by COVID-19. The collected evidence suggests that there is a difference, and that this difference is statistically significant. As a result of the substantial relationship between self-perception of digital skills and how students deal with reality based on their own self-perception, Saudi Arabia higher education ministry shifted teaching methods to be based on technology. Other significant findings and their implications for practice and theory were reported in this study. Finally, limitations and prospects for future research were also elaborated. © 2022 by the authors.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the digital skills of university teachers from two higher education institutions in Colombia. For data collection, the instrument implemented was the questionnaire on the digital competence of Higher Education teachers, which consists of 4 dimensions and 112 items. 105 teachers participated in the study, the study was quantitative, non-experimental and descriptive in scope. SPSS 22 software was used for data analysis and descriptive and correlational statistics were performed. Based on the results, it is highlighted that teachers use TIC in an instrumental way. The conclusions focus on the need to venture into content creation, augmented reality, innovation programs, strengthening research and the use of specific digital tools for each area of knowledge. A call is made to teachers and universities to continue promoting training and support programs to actively implement TIC in classes that require teacher qualification in educational processes. © 2023 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

By combining theories of social media participation and digital inequality, we explore issues regarding the prerequisites of participating through social media platforms, focusing especially on education. Through an analysis of data from a representative survey study in Finland (N = 3724), we illuminate the ambiguity of the perceived obstacles to both digital skills and political participation. We further build on the concept of digital capital to show the significant mediating effect of digital skills on education and participation. By utilizing the ISS (Internet Skills Scale), we break down digital skills into operational, information navigation, social, creative and mobile skills, and show how the operational skills have most significant mediator between education and political participation in social media. In studying digital inequality, we claim that the concept of digital capital is a valuable tool to illuminate the mechanisms for overcoming digital divides through the transaction of other forms of capital into digital capital, and digital capital to other forms of capital, in this case political capital. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Serious games are the focus of the current research agenda. They show promise for allowing students to learn and practice skills. In fewer studies, they are used for the development of academic competencies. Therefore, it is of interest to deepen the research on the benefits of serious games in academic education and training. This article presents a study using serious games aimed at higher education academics’ training for the development of digital competencies. The study was carried out with 56 academics, using the serious game called AstroCódigo. The study analyzed the level of acceptance of serious games using the TAM model and what factors the academics believe affect this acceptance. It is important to know possible barriers that affect the development of actions oriented to the formation of academic competencies through serious games, which can also affect the adoption of games as a resource for teaching situations. None of prior studies have focused on analyzing the technological acceptance of serious games used for the development of academic competencies. The results of this research indicate that participants believe that using serious games can be beneficial to drive digital competencies. However, there are aspects such as the highest academic qualification, work experience, professional development, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and fear of change associated with age rank which can play a negative role in the use and acceptance of digital technologies by academics, particularly serious games. These results may be a clue to the barriers linked to the fact that most of the participants in this study do not use serious games in their classes or for their digital skills training. Additionally, the possibility to try and fail and the increased level of challenges proposed in the serious games, related to enjoyment, were valued by academics, during the sessions with AstroCódigo. These findings open the door to organize strategies for academic training in digital competencies within higher education institutions. They can also impact the design decisions of new serious games. © The Authors Develop Digital.},

	abstract = {The objective of this publication is to identify the digital competencies that teachers in training have, within Higher Education Institutions in Mexico, through the analysis and systematization of previous research in 20 years from 2001 to date. For this purpose, a systematic review of the literature has been carried out through a systematic, explicit, and reproducible method. For this review, two filters were carried out: a practical criterion and a methodological quality criterion. As part of the first filter, five sources of information were used: EBSCO, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Redalyc. As a result, we found several articles with different approaches and research methodologies. It was found that teachers in higher education institutions have a medium–low mastery of digital competencies; the digital competencies with the highest mastery being those linked to the commitment and social responsibility of teachers in the use of Information and Communication Technology. Different institutions in Mexico have implemented different training programs in digital competencies for university teachers. As part of the training objectives of these projects, it is sought that teachers understand virtual environments, to make the change in their functions. It highlights the need for adequate training, not only in technology but also in pedagogy and curriculum, adequate infrastructure, and changes in institutional policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Hence, this case study examines the contradictions that an efl pst, from a university in Córdoba, Colombia, faced when incorporating digital literacy practices (dlp) in her planning as a result of her interaction with the activity theory (at) elements. It also describes the shifts in agency that occurred when she was exposed to contradictory dynamics of teaching. The study involved the pst and a group of 35 students in 10th grade. Class observations and semi-structured interviews with the pst revealed contradictions in terms of mediating artifacts, objects, division of labor, and rules. They also indicated how the identified contradictions could form the basis for a shift in her teaching activity system. These results suggest teaching programs should not only concentrate on how much our students learn new strategies but also on how much they have acquired transferable skills for transforming their contexts. © 2022, Ikala.

It also examines the major obstacles that hinder the development of the Filipino teachers’ PDC to be able to implement the CHED’s long-distance learning requirement as part of its recommended flexible learning to minimize COVID-19 infection. Using a systematic literature review as the primary method and peer-reviewed journal articles, reports, and books as sources of textual data, it argues that responding adequately to the CHED’s teaching mandate during the pandemic requires addressing the problems of lack of logistical support for teachers and students, such as weak and unstable Internet connection and lack of access to digital devices and educational technologies. It also needs to strengthen institutional support for information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure in colleges and universities and teachers’ ICT training to enhance their PDC and attitude toward online and long-distance learning. This chapter recommends that the Philippine government through the CHED must encourage more studies to understand fully the implementation barriers to improve the Filipino tertiary educators’ PDC during the current COVID-19. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This forced teachers more than ever to discover and deploy their technological skills, however, this transition brought with it uncertainty about the level of development of teachers’ digital skills. This article presents the elaboration and reliability analysis of an instrument called the Digital Competences Questionnaire in Non-Presential Environments (CD-NP), whose objective is to measure in a non-presential teaching environment the perspectives of high school students on skills. shown by their professors to implement the chair mediated by the use of digital tools. In the elaboration and validation of the questionnaire, 19 experts participated, who concluded that the basic digital competences required by teachers to respond to the new reality of teaching are: communicative interaction, the selection and design of digital materials, and the evaluation of learning. 392 students from a private university collaborated to carry out the reliability analysis. The findings show that the instrument has acceptable levels of reliability since various analyzes were carried out, the most representative being that each item and category exceeded a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.8093 and a McDonald’s Omega coefficient of 0.8958. It is concluded that the instrument has the necessary properties to be applied in the Mexican context, and opens the door to be implemented in other Latin American scenarios. © 2022, Universidad Compultense Madrid.

Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted by collecting data from 842 students. The dependent variable was student satisfaction in distance education. For the analyses, t-test, ANOVA (post hoc: Bonferroni), and linear regression methods were used. Results: Distance education student satisfaction was 178.21 ± 48.64. Student satisfaction was low among those who think that distance education is not more effective than face-to-face education, live in villages/towns, and have high perceived stress. Student satisfaction was high among those who do not have limited internet access, can access the internet via computer, follow the lessons regularly every week, think distance education is applicable in the health domain, can acquire instant feedback from the instructor, and have increased digital literacy. Conclusion: Distance education student satisfaction was found to be moderate. Student satisfaction in distance education increases as perceived stress levels decrease and digital literacy levels increase. © 2022,Revista da Escola de Enfermagem.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {This timely paper provides empirical evidence on the lived experiences of ten women from eight nationalities in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Germany, who voluntarily taught girls and women digital skills in 2020. I situated this multi-case feminist study within the digital skills gender divide phenomenon. I collected qualitative data through surveys and interviews with the teachers, remote observations of their digital skills lessons, and analysis of programme documents, including curricula. In this paper, I discuss two research questions: (1) “What motivated the women to teach digital literacy?” and (2) “Why do the teachers think the digital skills gender divide exists?” The hybrid approach to data coding and thematic analysis indicated that the teachers were motivated to teach digital literacy to support their students’ selfdevelopment and use digital skills in their daily lives. The teachers at the school in Germany were also motivated by advancing their social capital and societal integration, as six of the eight women teaching in Germany were migrants. The teachers from Bosnia & Herzegovina were motivated by overcoming the systemic gender inequality that the digital skills gender divide encapsulates. The teachers also identified various personal, community, and societal causes of the digital skills gender divide. On the micro-level, they noted that girls engage in risk avoidance behaviour from a young age, limiting their digital skills development. On the mesolevel, women lack exposure to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) within their families and communities. On the macro-level, the teachers in Bosnia & Herzegovina highlighted that girls living in urban areas could access ICT more often than those living in rural areas. This paper offers resolutions to the digital skills gender divide, concluded from the teachers’ evidence, such as educational opportunities, gender diversity hiring in technical roles in the ICT sector, and policy development to underpin solutions and incentivise compliance. This paper is my contribution to centralising in the scholarship the lived experiences and perspectives of diverse women who are at the forefront of the digital skills gender divide. © 2022},

Settings: Three nursing colleges located in Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do in Korea. Participants: Participants were 259 nursing students aged 18–29 years who lived in the Seoul metropolitan area. Methods: Self-reported data on variables including attitudes toward online learning, digital literacy, self-efficacy, and eHL, were collected and analyzed using an independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance. The mediating effects were verified through the bootstrapping method using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results: The results indicated that although attitudes toward online learning affected digital literacy, they did not directly influence eHL. Additionally, digital literacy and self-efficacy were also found to be associated with eHL and mediate the relationship between online learning attitudes and eHL. Conclusions: As online nursing education rapidly becomes commonplace due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes toward online learning, digital literacy, and self-efficacy must be improved to enhance eHL. © 2022},

The DiKoLAN framework (Digital Competencies for Teaching in Science Education) describes basic digital competencies for the teaching profession in the natural sciences precisely for this purpose. In this article, we describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a university course based on DiKoLAN which promotes the digital competencies of science teachers. As an example, the learning module Data Processing in Science Education is presented, and its effectiveness is investigated. For this purpose, we used a questionnaire developed by the Working Group Digital Core Competencies to measure self‐efficacy, which can also be used in the future to promote digital competencies among pre‐service teachers. The course evaluation showed a positive increase in the students’ self‐efficacy expectations. Overall, the paper thus contributes to teacher education by using the course as a best-practice example—a blueprint for designing new courses and for implementing a test instrument for a valid evaluation. © 2022 by the author.

A self-report questionnaire was used to measure learning presence, learning flow, digital literacy, and academic achievement. Analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 and SPSS PROCESS Macro (4.0). Results: The mediating effect of learning flow on the effect of learning presence on academic achievement was 0.42, and the moderated mediation index of digital literacy was 0.17. Learning flow showed a mediating effect on the relationship between learning presence and academic achievement. Digital literacy had a moderated mediation effect on the relationship between learning presence and academic achievement that was mediated by learning flow. Conclusion: The intensity of the mediating effect of nursing students’ learning presence on academic achievement through learning flow increases as the level of digital literacy increases.

However, this transition brought with it uncertainty about the degree of development that teachers would have of these competencies. In this research, rather than taking a frame of reference that would allow identifying the TDC that a teacher required in pre-pandemic conditions, we worked on the design and validation of an instrument to assess the level of TDC displayed by teachers during the pandemic. To carry out the validation, a variation of the Delphi Method was used, which was called the Simplified Digital Delphi method (MDDS), in which a group of 27 experts participated in a virtual context. The results show that the instrument has high levels of validity since each item and category exceeded a V-Aiken coefficient of 0.8, and a confidence interval value (ICI) of 0.6, so it can be applied for the purpose to the one that was designed. © 2022 Authors.

The approach used in this research is quantitative, with the data collection technique being a survey model. The research design used a quasi-experimental model with a pretest and posttest design. The samples were physics education students of UIN Sulthan Thaha Saifuddin Jambi, with a total sample of 42 students. Data analysis was conducted through several stages, namely: a) the first stage was to analyze category classification, namely classifying student abilities into very good category (A), good category (B), sufficient category (C), and poor category (D), based on the score of the measurement results of the three variables; b) the second stage is to test the correlation between variables. Correlation data analysis was performed with SPSS 25 software.

	abstract = {For the planning and implementation of lessons with digital technologies, a subject-specific technology-related professional competence of teachers is of central importance. However, the competency frameworks developed so far remain in a general perspective and do not explicitly address subject-specific issues. Furthermore, digital competencies are predominantly measured with subject-unspecific self-assessment instruments, as subject-specific operationalizations for this area are not yet available in a differentiated form. In this article, the framework for Digital Competencies for Teaching in Science Education (DiKoLAN), a subject-specific framework for pre-service science teachers, is introduced, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, first results of a self-assessment tool based on the framework are described. DiKoLAN defines competency areas highly specific to science, as well as more general competency areas that include aspects common to all subjects. Each competency area is described by competency expectations, which, in turn, are structured with reference to the four technology-related dimensions of the TPACK framework (i.e., Technological and Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and three levels of performance (Name, Describe, Use/Apply). Derived from DiKoLAN, a corresponding self-assessment instrument (DiKoLAN-Grid) was developed and empirically tested for the two competency areas, (n = 118) and Information Search and Evaluation (n = 90), in biology student teachers. By means of path models, tendencies regarding structural correlations of the four components Special Tools (TK), Content-specific Context (TCK), Methods and Digitality (TPK), and Teaching (TPACK) are presented for both competency areas and discussed, as well as in comparison to previously conducted, subject-unspecific surveys. © 2021, MDPI.

	abstract = {The relevance of the research topic is determined by the need to provide the agricultural sector of the Republic of Buryatia with highly qualified personnel. The paper aims to assess the possibility of forming professional competencies of students, considering the specifics of agricultural production and the trends in the digital development of the industry. The paper uses modeling methods in practice. The results of the analysis of the applied Federal State Educational Standard of Higher Education and professional standards of activity (in terms of requirements for the formation of students’ digital knowledge, skills, and abilities) indicate the mutual inconsistency of the content of these requirements, which makes it challenging to adapt educational programs and set professional tasks with their focus on the formation of digital competencies for work in today’s agriculture. The authors conclude that it is necessary to adapt educational programs to the requirements of the digital economy in the agricultural sector. This will actualize the content of educational programs of higher education of higher agricultural education institutions, considering the employers’ needs in specialists with competencies in various areas of agriculture and a set of digital knowledge, skills, and abilities applicable to the agricultural sector. Thus, the paper focuses on forming the professional competencies of students in higher agricultural education programs to ensure the digital development of agricultural organizations. The paper presents a rationale for approaches to adapting basic professional educational programs (BEP) to the digital economy, in which a special role is given to “Applied Computer Science,” “Economics,” and “Management.” The authors consider the possibilities of setting and orienting the content of professional tasks on the formation of digital competencies. The main aspects of the transformation of higher agricultural education in the conditions of Industry 4.0 are presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Taking a human-media-machine interaction model as the basis for discussion, this article highlights the growing importance of digital technology as well as technological principles for human communication and interaction. Communication technology and the influence of technology on culture and society require a broad understanding of media literacy in the sense of digital literacy. By broadening the theoretical basis of media literacy education, making, coding and tinkering qualify as approaches for achieving these goals. The discussion uses the four classic dimensions of media literacy and action theory to argue in favor of these approaches. © 2022 Author(s).},

The development of an e-book that is suitable for rural areas is extremely needed. This paper aimed to describe our work in advancing our previous paper-based environmental book to be a digital-based flip-book in strengthening digital literacy among elementary school students and teachers in rural areas. The method used in this work consisted of development research and using many tools such as Flip PDF Pro and Canva. As the result, the e-flipbook has many interesting features such as videos, popup pictures, games, online worksheets, etc. It is also very interesting for both teachers and students, easy to use, and has the potential to help digital literacy through a learning process. However, this e-flipbook needs improvement. It is suggested that the instructions on some features such as buttons and popup pictures need to be clarified, and the book needs to be supported by clues or answers to questions for confirmation to support independent learning activities. Thirdly, the design needs to be improved to make it more attractive. © 2022 IEEE.},

However, the literature on this topic indicates the persistence of certain challenges relating to the accessibility of OERs. In this regard, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is presented as a possible solution to this problem as it advocates the personalisation of learning and facilitates the achievement of universal digital literacy. This study seeks to investigate the accessibility of OERs’ design for those early stages in education that are managed by the Spanish education authorities. To this end, a guide of indicators has been designed to assess OERs in accordance with the principles of UDL. The sample is made up of 67 OERs, selectively based on a number of requirements. This study uses a quantitative and exploratory research methodology for the analysis of the data obtained. The main findings highlight the shortcomings of OERs in terms of accessibility, adaptability and universality, demonstrating that OERs do not respond to the principles of UDL. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, searching for diverse information on different topics, either personally or through participation in groups, virtual communities, and academic and educational social networks, leads us to find an infinite amount of content on the Internet. Therefore, ICTs play an essential role since they not only facilitate the use and allow access to an innumerable volume of information. Consequently, this amount of content poses two essential challenges: to avoid documentary noise and to distinguish relevant information. Derived from this, content curation allows the organization, classification, storage and dissemination of information offered by multiple online sources, for which the selected content curator is in itself, the person in charge of gathering, organizing and sharing the best and most relevant content of a specific topic, so that in universities we can find above all that students develop not only the skills of each subject but also digital skills, which allow students to become digital citizens or content curators prepared for the new productive environments of the knowledge society. For this reason, the following study was carried out with the objective of generating a model to develop digital, informational, and multimodal skills based on a measurement and comparison of the level of mastery of digital skills of university students in Mexico and Spain. A total of 217 students from different university careers from different institutions such as the Normal Superior Institute of Campeche, Tecnologico de Monterrey and University of Malaga participated in the research. They answered an ad hoc online questionnaire, which evaluates ICT competencies of higher education teachers. The results show different levels of mastery (high, medium, and low), with practically all the students surveyed owning a personal computer (97%), a cell phone (98%) and an Internet connection (97.5%). The differences between students according to their country of origin begin to emerge when we look at the usual place from which they connect. The conclusions of the study visualize the digital competencies of university students as the main characteristic of the role of content curation as an alternative for the refinement of searches, the dissemination of information and scientific updating, which favors the information management of teachers working in these Higher Education Universities and Institutions evaluated.  © 2022 IEEE.},

We present a proof of concept and epistemological valorisation of digital literacy previously underestimated. This epistemological valorisation focuses on teaching digital literacy through understanding how teachers work - pedagogical planning, teacher training, syllabus design, practical work - enabling us to train technology producers instead of passive technology consumers, to enable agents instead of clients. The term “digital” will refer to 21st-century digital literacy. To “think digital” will refer to the mental process carried out by digital natives when conducting operations involving ICT - as their native language and framework. The pedagogical background is paramount to the structures underlying teaching of 21st-century digital literacy, characterised by its disruptive building process achieved through the acknowledgement of epistemological foundations. High school teaching of 21st century digital literacy is by no means at ground zero. The fundamental concepts to be conveyed remain the same: electric coding, input and output devices, memories, processors and transistors – the process/system is just faster and smaller. The development of a proof of concept was built according to a DSR framework, in an iterative way, giving evidence of architecture configuration, an asset of information, of tools, procedures, and attitudes. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

This paper adopts a case study approach and selects the top ten international fashion colleges as the research sample to analyze three aspects: theme-based teaching, blended teaching approach, and credit certification, and finds that the existing international fashion colleges' online education is mainly based on design-based theme-based courses. This paper adopts a blended teaching study with student-initiated learning at its core and found that: the online education of existing international fashion institutions mainly focuses on design-based theme-based courses; blended teaching, with student-initiated learning and direct participation in corporate practice projects as the core; and credit certification, which still focuses on credit assessment for enrolled students while providing industry certification examination courses. This paper concludes that the online course aspect of international fashion institutions can increase the proportion of live streaming, produce clearer and smoother streaming videos, require multiple means of management in virtual community management, and also consider helping students make the optimal choice of courses based on data recommendations.  © 2022 ACM.},

This article explores an approach for addressing this issue, which is to incorporate data and digital literacy training into standard archaeological curricula. This approach consists of covering a wide range of topics that contribute to digital and data fluency that include both practical digital skills and discussions aimed at contextualizing the tools into larger, ethical, and sociopolitical frameworks.

	abstract = {As online learning modes become more common, this can exacerbate educational inequalities for learners who do not have the ability to utilise these modes effectively. This has been seen in the COVID-19 crisis where there has been a shift to remote and distance learning modalities despite the limited ability for all learners to benefit equitably. In particular, digital literacy remains a fundamental barrier to benefitting from online and blended learning. This paper reports on a study that investigated the digital literacy needs and preferences of peri-urban, marginalised youth when utilising online and blended learning in South Africa and how online education platforms can be designed to better suit such groups. It is argued that for online courses to truly support marginalised groups, it needs to be ensured that these learners are digitally equipped and digitally literate in terms of accessing, utilising, and benefitting equitably from online learning. © 2022 IGI Global.

As part of the Erasmus+ project Digital Skills for Integration and Active Citizenship (DISC), we developed a tool for self-assessment of digital skills, with which young people who participated in the survey assessed their knowledge before and after the workshops. The findings show that a multisensory space is an effective tool for obtaining digital skills. The young people who participated in the research were motivated to participate and co-create a multisensory space. During the workshops, they gained valuable knowledge and co-created a space that they shared with other workshop participants. The self-assessment tool proved to be an exceptionally statistically reliable tool with high reliability as a whole and in sets. Furthermore, it also turned out that users reported improvements in the areas that we addressed in the workshops. This showed that the young people understood the survey and responded to it honestly, as they did not report better knowledge in areas that had not been covered in the workshops. © 2022, Pedagoska Obzorja d.o.o.

Design, Methodology, and Approach: Quantitative analysis was carried out using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Model with data collected from 901 students who fully experienced 2-year study online at different universities in Vietnam. The structural model was built with digital literacy as the primary indicator and other variables were included based on modified version of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) by adopting performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, habit, and hedonic motivation variables specifically for education sector. Self-efficacy was added to eliminate possible bias in technology acceptance. Results: From the results of model estimation, digital literacy presented positive impact on the online distribution of higher education in Vietnam. The mediating effects of various indicators such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, habit, hedonic motivation, and self-efficacy are significantly determined by research model. Conclusion: The higher level of digital literacy of the students, the more likely that they will use technology in higher education study, especially online learning. Additionally, the mediating effects of indicators from the UTAUT2 theoretical model were also evident to be positively significant. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://Creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {This article shares the results of a systematic mapping of digital competency (DC) studies among preservice teachers in Uruguay from 2000 to mid-2021. The aim of the study has been to have a general view of preservice teachers’ DC building as far as it is approached and studied by different national and international academics and researchers. The following specific objectives were established: (1) identifying research teams dealing with DCs in preservice teacher education in Uruguay and their institutional affiliation, (2) identifying methodological approaches, and (3) mapping pre-service teachers’ DC-related sub-topics, addressed by researchers. Among other findings, 38% used mixed, qualitative, and quantitative methods, 32% applied qualitative techniques, and 20% reported experiences, either related to classroom practices or to the organization and management of educational institutions. 7% were the result of quantitative studies and 3% were action research projects. Topics addressed are DC and the place it should have in the curriculum, teaching practices to train preservice teachers, preservice teachers’ perceptions about their own digital competencies, the level of preservice teachers’ digital competencies and public policies regarding DC building. Research results reveal that preservice teachers are currently experiencing an ongoing renewal process, which still shows fragmentation and a variety of approaches to DC training, although some important achievements are also evident. Mostly, these achievements are in reference to the presence of an initial group of academics who have decided to focus on the topic from the point of view of a situated practice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 has brought serious challenges to education and many other sectors. Within the educational context, the main difficulties experienced have been reported as challenges related to not only mechanical impediments—such as technology or infrastructure—but also to methodological and personal features, such as lack of motivation or online learning/teaching experiences. The abrupt transition from face-to-face to online education has created the need for some specific abilities, such as digital literacy on the side of the learners at all educational levels. In this context, this mixed-method study aims to determine the digital literacy levels of learners belonging to different school levels and whether age, gender and school degree were significant variables. This study also investigates the technology-related challenges students experienced during COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 510 participants representing different school levels, age groups, and genders; in addition, a smaller representative group (n = 30) revealed their own evaluations related to their levels of digital literacy and the technology-related challenges they had about online learning. The findings suggest that there is a statistically significant relationship between students’ digital literacy and their gender and school degree, while age was not found to be a statistically significant variable. The qualitative self-reported data suggested that learners have sufficient levels of digital literacy, and that the major technology-related challenges were reported to be lack of the necessary technologies and difficulties in adapting to a new approach to learning. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to identify the changes in student roles and digital literacy and the strategies to improve motivation and learning achievement in online learning environments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a rapid evidence assessment review study based on the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA), it is concluded that student roles have experienced great changes, that students have assumed multiple roles and that they are socially and cognitively engaged in their roles, roles that can be promoted by information technologies. Their digital literacy, individually varying, needs to be improved although it has undergone improvements. Digital technologies and social regulation can improve online learning achievements. Teaching strategies, teacher–student cooperation, gamification, and computer applications can improve online learning achievements.

However, due to the lack of digital literacy capabilities of the elderly, it is difficult to use digital devices, making it difficult to live. Therefore, this paper outlined the impact of the digital divide on daily life and the ability of the elderly to use digital information. Through this, we propose an educational program that combines IT and humanities to improve digital literacy in the elderly. IT and humanities do not seem to match, but the convergence of the two is essential. Hardware and software, technology and technology, technology and design are being combined. Accordingly, technology and humanities can combine competency is becoming more critical. Therefore, the educational program proposed in this thesis combines a decision tree with a game and allows the elderly to acquire IT knowledge while playing a game naturally. This educational program was conducted for 23 older adults in their 60s in J city, South Korea. The average satisfaction of the study participants in education was 4.13(±0.65). In addition, the post-test mean of the recognition area in digital literacy was 3.02(±0.64) (p<.05), and the post-test mean of the behavior area in digital literacy was 3.67(±0.59) (p<.01), which was statistically significant compared to the pre-test. © 2022 Sciedu Press.

Digital literacy, also known as virtual learning, has the potential to improve lifelong learning. Workplace skills evolve at such a rapid pace that no school system can keep up with the continual need to alter how we work and live. Most crucially, our society's profound changes require young people to acquire new abilities. Malaysia has a long-term vision that calls for sustainable and productivity-driven growth that can only be accomplished with digitally literate employees. Although to some extent Malaysia education system has been initiating, there is very limited research that focuses on what drives digital literacy. There is no proper framework or guidelines that can be used as a blueprint to prepare the young graduates in the 21st-century workforce. The purpose of the study is to examine the drivers of digital literacy that can be taught in higher institutions and apply in today's digital workplace. This research focused on young adults as a unit of analysis and a quantitative method was used to collect the data. A total of 300 young individuals responded through self-administered questionnaires. The finding of the research showed that critical skills, operational skills, visual learning style, collaborative learning style and learning system enhance digital literacy. Finding further recommend that digital literacy improve both academic performance and employability. From this research, solutions can be proposed to both academicians and employers in achieving the digital literate graduates for the 21st-century workforce. © 2022 Knowledge Management & E-Learning.

The threads connecting these digital literacy practices and research are loosely stitched together into a national tapestry, full of holes and imperfections. Yet, just as Canadian singer/songwriter Leonard Cohen suggests, these cracks allow the light to shine through. By reviewing research from across the country, this chapter illuminates distinctive patterns in teaching, learning, and research into digital literacies and digital competencies in faculties of education. Singular threads reveal trends that enhance digital literacy learning and digital competency development. Research into digital readiness, a digital competence profile, and self-study scholarship reveals the patchy nature of measurement of digital literacies in Canadian faculties of education. This chapter concludes with insights into contextual factors that impact teaching and learning in faculties of education in Canada. This chapter illuminates limitations and barriers, the cracks in the development of digital literacies in teacher education programs, which allow individual lights of innovation to shine across this vast and diverse country. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The objective of this article is to determine the relationship between digital competencies and academic performance in students of a Peruvian technicalproductive education institution. For this purpose, the questionnaire of Gutiérrez-Castillo et al. (2017), validated by local experts, was contextualized and applied virtually through the digital platform to a sample represented by 52 students of the specialty of “Computer Operation” of the Technical-productive education center “Tarma” for having the largest number of students at the time of the research. It was obtained as a result that 46% and 44% of the students presented a good or superior level of digital skills and academic performance respectively; in addition, there is a statistically significant positive relationship between digital competences and academic performance (0.572). It is concluded that digital skills are a factor related to academic performance in students of the specialty analyzed, so if a student has greater digital skills, they will present better academic performance © 2022, Revista de Ciencias Sociales.All Rights Reserved.},

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital technology and digital literacy in teaching and learning English. This study aims to firstly investigate the applications of digital technology and the level of digital literacy in learning and teaching English. Secondly, to measure the significant differences between EFL teachers and students in their usage of technology and digital literacies in English classrooms. Two questionnaires were distributed to 150 students and 40 teachers. The data were analyzed descriptively using SPSS 23.0. The findings show that students’ use of digital technology was the highest in learning vocabularies and lowest in reading skills, while teachers’ highest use was for general teaching practices and lowest for reading skills. Participants have high digital literacies. The findings supported the null hypotheses related to the significant difference between usage of digital technology for language pedagogy. These findings offer implications for policymakers towards designing plans to integrate digital technologies in the language classrooms of marginalized societies such as B40 in Malaysia. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {As students transition into tertiary blended learning environments, their digital literacy in terms of technical capabilities have potential to impact on their access to digital resources. The first foundational year of STEM degrees includes compulsory courses across a broad range of scientific areas, each of which incorporates online technology in a discipline-specific manner. Given the diversity of online resources that STEM students need to access across their first-year coursework, this study applies learning analytical methods to determine whether students’ perceived level of digital literacy has an effect on their navigation of learning management systems (LMS) and overall academic performance. The frequency and nature of LMS interactivity were examined across four first-year STEM courses offered in the same semester at a single institution, using a K-means cluster analysis to group student responses. It was observed that high achieving students accessed LMS resources more frequently than mid or low-achieving students across all four STEM courses. Students’ perceived level of digital literacy was collected via survey (n = 282), and students were sorted high (n = 106) and low-level (n = 176) of perceived digital literacy—HDL and LDL, respectively. HDL students were not consistently found in the high-achieving academic group and did not perform better in their overall grade when compared to LDL students. LDL students were observed to perform better in specific online assessment tasks, which may be attributed to their increased frequency of LMS interactivity. These findings highlight the delicate balance between students’ perceived level of digital literacy, motivation for engaging with online learning environments, and academic performance. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We utilized convenience sampling strategy to collect our data from a Hong Kong secondary school and we used content analysis to analyze our data. The validity and reliability of our data analysis were ensured by high intercoder agreement rates and Cohen's Kappa statistics. We found ten digital literacy skills of basic operation of devices and software that students demonstrate. In addition, some identified digital literacy skills are applied more consistently by students than other identified digital literacy skills. We discussed the findings in the context of implications to help researchers and professionals identify and assess essential digital literacy skills for online assessments.

This type of research is ex post facto with quantitative data. The method used was comparative causal differential with path analysis. The problems posed are (1) whether there is a direct effect of digital literacy, self-awareness, career planning on learning achievement, and (2) whether there is an indirect effect of digital literacy and self-awareness on learning achievement. The results showed that (1) Digital Literacy and Self-awareness directly affect Career Planning by 42.8%. Taken together, digital literacy, self-awareness, and career planning directly affect student learning achievement. The effect of these three variables to student achievement is 50.9%. (2) The direct effect of digital literacy and self-awareness on learning achievement tends to be dominant compared to the indirect effect through Career planning. The total effect of digital literacy on learning achievement is 0.33, with details of the direct effect of 0.263 and the indirect effect of 0.068 through career planning. The total effect of self-awareness on learning achievement is 0.4809, with further information of the direct effect of 0.345, and the indirect effect of career planning is 0.1359. Research recommendations need to be expanded by adding respondents and job literacy variables among prospective TVET teacher students as independent variables. © 2022},

In the modern world, a competitive analyst working in the field of economics must have not only professional competence, but also digital competence, which includes not only digital skills, but also a set of knowledge and views on the nature and role of information technologies and opportunities, as well as relevant legal and ethical principles. The article deals with the analyzes of the modern theoretical foundations and approaches to the development of digital literacy within the lifelong learning processes: namely, one of the tools for determining the level of formation of digital competence using Tsifrogram test (which is based on the conceptual model of digital competence of citizens DigComp - The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens) is described and analyzed in detail. The research was carried out in line with the competence-based, personality-activity and communicative approaches. The training program for economic analysts used active and interactive teaching methods and practices. The results of the level of digital competence formation among students of economic specialties of the university are presented. The main recommendations for increasing the level of the students' digital competence are analyzed, identified, and highlighted. In the future, it is planned to develop a roadmap for increasing the level of students' digital competence during their studies at the university. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors},

The Toolkit resulted from the co -operation and collaboration of five EU universities and was based on the ASSURE instructional design model. The Toolkit offers a self- access, self- paced, non-linear, fully online set of ten stand-alone units which offer a range of materials and activities to develop those skills pertinent to VM academic language and digital literacy needs. Evaluation by a group of VMs resident in EU countries highlight the positive impact of the Toolkit and validates the instrument as fit for purpose. Noteworthy aspects include its usefulness in supporting student autonomy, improving digital capabilities and academic language mastery,a positive experience of a flexible learning experience along with access to open resources of international scope and dissemination under the Creative Commons licence. © 2022, The Author(s).},

While previous studies have focused on student digital skills and digital practices in well-resourced environments, there is a research gap concerning digital literacy as a social practice in resource constrained environments, such as South African universities. A qualitative approach is used to explore the acquisition of discipline-specific digital literacy practices by a purposive sample of three first-year students from two extended degree programme courses. The findings reveal that the discipline-specific learning and assessment activities instantiated students' digital literacy practices in the technical, cognitive, and social-emotional dimensions. Furthermore, the participants acquired digital literacies in the technical and cognitive dimension. The research findings provide insight to how other higher education educators in developing contexts could integrate digital literacies into course curricula as a means of building students' capacity on discipline-specific digital literacies. © 2022 IGI Global.

Teachers must be aware of the importance of mastering digital literacy in the learning experience. After the Covid-19 epidemic, this research intends to examine educator knowledge of the application of digital literacy in the learning process. The study employs a quantitative descriptive technique to carefully review the types of teacher digital literacy awareness, supportive factors in the usage of digital literacy, and the consequences of tutor computer literacy recognition following the Covid 19 epidemic. The research process was conducted in the Islamic Public Senior High School (MAN) in Palembang, Sumatra. The consistent findings indicated that positive' competence of digital literacy was significant in terms of their capacity to use technology about 100%. The most influential supporting factor correctly is the motivation of friends (97.90%). The implication of using digital literacy for teachers is the execution of virtual meeting learning (94%). The logical conclusion of this study is that teachers develop awareness in utilizing technology, and it is more effortless to convey material after the Covid-19 pandemic. Mastery of digital literacy for teachers needs to be carefully reviewed to the stage of performance and application to students. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In order to systematically introduce (prospective) teachers to teaching in the digital world and to lay the foundations for concepts that are meaningful in terms of physics education, essential aspects of learning with and via digital media must be conveyed. In addition to cross-curricular competencies, it is essential to consider subject-specific competencies for the natural sciences since the formation of subject-specific knowledge on the use of digital media in the classroom (TPACK) is the decisive factor for acceptance behaviour and the intention for later use. The questions remain as to what core competencies must be built up by all (prospective) science teachers by the end of their studies and in which sections of university teacher training this should take place. Since no competence frameworks specific to the teaching of science were previously available, nine researchers from eight universities came together to develop a suitable orientation framework. As a result, this contribution presents the structured and graded framework "DiKoLAN - Digitale Kompetenzen für das Lehramt in den Naturwissenschaften [Digital Competencies for Teaching in Science Education]"(see https://dikolan.de).  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Findings from a large qualitative sample of 65 Israeli elementary and middle-school teachers-experts in technology-enhanced pedagogy, demonstrated that their perspectives in semi-structured interviews were mostly consistent with their actual behavior observed in classrooms. Teachers over-emphasized certain competencies (searching for knowledge, photo-visual thinking, socio-emotional learning, constructing knowledge), while others competencies were significantly less common (real-time thinking, branching literacy and problem-solving skills). Based on bottom-up coding, we identified unique characteristics of digital literacy, suggested several modifications of the DC, 5C and DigComp frameworks, and mapped the level of instructional strategies (foundational, intermediate, or advanced) used to develop students' digital literacies. We discuss the implications of the findings for educational theory and practice. © 2022 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.},

The research was carried out with the participation of a total of 463 university students. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to investigate the validity and reliability of the digital skills survey. Consequently, research on the validity and reliability of the digital skills survey in the Russian environment was conducted. 25 items and six factors (access to and management of digital content, digital empathy, use of digital means, digital safety, communication of digital content, creation of digital content) were identified after the analysis. Future research should employ the adapted survey to assess the level of students’ digital skills. In addition, the survey’s validity may be analyzed in the context of other cultures. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

Building the engineering skill self-efficacy of students should be a key goal for educational institutions as they develop necessary skills for future engineers. This work investigated structural factors influencing engineering skill self-efficacy by conducting a questionnaire survey among 1,316 engineering students in Thailand. Structural equation modeling was used to validate the proposed model. The research results indicated that engineering skill self-efficacy was contributed to digital skills, learning strategies, and achievement goal orientation. Learning strategies were predicted by achievement goal orientation, and they positively associated with digital skills. These empirical findings reflect a sustainable educational development structure for engineering education. The results may benefit educators by specifying methods of educational development and learning activity design and promoting pedagogical system to develop learners' characteristics to enhance their engineering skill self-efficacy. Students can then be prepared with digital skills to apply to their further work, which will affect capacity building and the overall image of a country's development.  © 2013 IEEE.},

How faculty’s digital literacy translates into hybrid and online teaching environments and how faculty categorize their technologically based self-efficacy is also explored, particularly the role of user-based decision making through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Findings suggest that, to engage digitally immigrant and digitally native faculty teaching with technology, training should be scaffolded, with a particular focus on screening and assessing potential participants, with a focus on rigorous training that moves faculty from one stage or behavior change to another.

Aim: The main purpose of the study is to investigate the level of Αrmy Nurses familiarity with the most well-known New World Wide Web ( Web 2.0) tools, as well as to designate their attitudes and perceptions in relation to the use of these New Technologies during educational process. Individual objective is to examine the ability of Army Nurses to use these tools to their continuing educational and professional development. Material and Method: This is a cross-sectional research study. The referring population is the active Officer Nurses of Greece, in the first two months (Jan-Feb) of 2019. A sample of convenience was used. Results: The population belong to generations X and Y. All of them have very good access to Internet and New Technologies. Differences were observed in the age of first use of the Internet, the way they use Technology and the different use of Social Media Networks. Although the vast majority of them have a positive attitude towards the use of the Internet and New Technologies in their lifelong learning, they were proved, according to this research, incapable of using them for this purpose. The only exception is Social Media. Conclusions: Officer Nurses are a professional team with very good access to Technology and a positive attitude towards the Internet and New Technologies.

	abstract = {Purpose: The introduction of distance learning technologies that was urgently adopted on a large scale in the spring of 2020 again resumed discussions about the digital competence of teachers. The necessity of improvement of content components of educational process is shown. Design/Methodology/Approach: The article substantiates the methodological basis for changing approaches to the staffing of pedagogical workers in the field of digitalization of education. The thesis is considered on the need to institutionalize educational activities in the digital environment, first of all, in solving issues of a regulatory and economic nature. Findings: The requirements for the teacher are reflected in scientifically based concepts and legal regulation. The used competence-based approach led to allocation of such key significant properties of the teacher as value orientation, general culture, educational and informative, info-communicative, social and labor. Originality/Value: The authors found that the process of digitalization of education is quite regulated, but the issues of quality control of knowledge are not fully regulated by law. In this regard, it is proposed to form ideas about the developing regulation of the model of digital competencies of a teacher, the development of distance education in general education, about systemic organizational measures, and support infrastructure that can regulate this area, supporting the direction of personification of education. The need to create the concept of additional professional education of pedagogical personnel as a set of provisions and ideas, taking into account the formation of new professional competencies, is methodologically justified; identify trends, patterns, principles, methods, and forms in the formation of the teacher's retraining process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Prospective teachers need both general and subject-specific digital competencies. However, available competency frameworks usually address only non-subject-specific general digital competencies. Although the joint framework curriculum of the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland not only provides a comprehensive definition of expected digital student competencies, but also suggestions for linking them to and implementing them in subject lessons, there is still no integral planning and structuring for subject-specific teacher training in the canton of Thurgau. For a curricular design of the promotion of subject-specific digital competencies, three competency frameworks for the study programs Primary level, Secondary level 1, and Secondary level 2 at the Thurgau University of Education were derived in expert interviews based on the DiKoLAN framework (Digital Competencies for Teaching in Science Education). While there are significant overlaps, the original reference framework clearly needs to be adapted. Furthermore, there are important commonalities between the newly formed individual competency frameworks. The methodological approach has proven to be fruitful and is recommended to follow-up studies and studies with similar research questions for imitation.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic initiated a fundamental change in learning and teaching in (higher-) education [HE]. On short notice, traditional teaching in HE suddenly had to be transformed into online teaching. This shift into the digital world posed a great challenge to in-service teachers at schools and universities, and pre-service teachers, as the acquisition of digital competences was no longer an option but a real necessity. The previously rather hidden or even neglected importance of teachers’ digital competences for successful teaching and learning became manifest and clearly visible. In this work, we investigate necessary digital competences to ensure high quality teaching and learning in and beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based upon the European DigComp 2.1 (Carretero et al., 2017), DigCompEdu (Redecker, 2017) frameworks, the Austrian Digi.kompP framework (Virtuelle PH, 2021), and the recommendations given by German Education authorities (KMK 2017; KMK 2021; HRK 2022), we developed a curriculum consisting of 5 modules: 2 for individual digital media competence, and 3 for media didactic competence. For each module, competence-oriented learning goals and corresponding micro-learning contents were defined to meet the needs of teachers while considering their time constraints. Based on three online workshops, the curriculum and the corresponding learning goals were discussed with university teachers, pre-service teachers, and policymakers. The content of the curriculum was perceived as highly relevant for these target groups; however, some adaptations were required. From the university teachers’ perspective, we got feedback that they were overwhelmed with the situation and urgently needed digital competences. Policymakers suggested that further education regarding digital competences needs to offer a systematic exchange of experiences with peers. From the perspective of in-service teachers, it was stated that teacher education should focus more on digital competences and tools. In this paper, we will present the result of the workshop series that informed the design process of the DIGIVID curriculum for teaching professionals. © 2021 Academic Conferences Limited.

	abstract = {Digital literacy is a critical element of multiliteracy framework required to thrive in digital era and perceived as cross-curricular competencies, yet it is not adequately addressed in English language teaching. This paper explores the traits of the authentic academic digital practices in the course outlines of English language skills conducive for digital literacy development, examines the extent to which digital literacy are infused in the authentic academic digital practices of the English courses and proposes the procedure of infusing digital literacy in the authentic academic digital practices of English language teaching. The study employs content analysis to address the data—the traits of authentic academic digital practices in fifty-five course outlines of English language skills subjects from six English Language Education and English Literature Study Programs in Jakarta and West Java. The findings recognize the traits of authentic academic digital practices in the digital academic products, such as the answers to open-/closed-ended questions, essays, presentation slides, papers, videos, podcasts, recorded audio-visual presentations, and reports diversely used across the courses. These digital academic products are used merely as the media in which English is used; only English proficiency is highlighted. The underpinning digital competencies to create the media, the media creation process and the media as digital academic products are not sufficiently addressed and measured. Digital literacy is infused in the authentic academic digital practices of English language teaching through five stages of identifying the components of digital literacies and the authentic academic digital practices and products, analysing the descriptors of digital literacies components pertaining to authentic academic digital practices and products, integrating the descriptors of digital literacies into learning outcomes, embedding digital literacies into academic products, employing authentic academic digital practices in the learning process, and assessing digital literacies as cross-curricular competencies. © 2022, Universitas Negeri Makassar- Faculty of Languages and Literature.

Data were collected from 40 physics education students in Tasikmalaya, consisting of 13 males and 27 females with an average age of 20 years. Data collection techniques included a literature study, expert validation, digital literacy test, and a questionnaire on student perceptions. Expert validation was obtained from three experts using a Likert scale and processed by the validation value equation developed by Aiken. The expert validation resulted in a value of 0.92, which met the minimum validation requirements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the PBLMS3 application in improving digital literacy in online physics learning was determined by a statistical process using the Wilcoxon test. Based on its results, the t-value was -0.4752, with a p-value of 0.00 < 0.05. This means that the PBLMS3 application is effective for and capable of improving students' digital literacy. Further research is recommended to determine other factors capable of improving digital literacy.  ©Authors.},

We analyse policy documents on digital education as cultural texts which communicate cultural values. Methodologically, we understand policy ideas as deriving from the larger culture. Our analysis first explores how abilities are connected to economic growth, as well as what kind of history of ideas frames this presumption. Second, it explores the assumption of constantly changing technologies and the workers who must adapt themselves to such a situation. Third, the article interrogates citizenship as a cultural idea within the current policy ideas about digital skills. Our account offers new perspectives on the analysis of biocapitalism and provides a specific analysis of how able-mindedness is foregrounded in digital education. It argues that digitalisation, as a policy matter, intensifies discourses emphasising the development of abilities and that this social tendency is neither value neutral nor necessary. © 2022 The Author(s).

This technology is not limited to business, it is also used in education, entertainment, or personal correspondence. Emails are also present in the everyday life of children: they are required to join websites, social networks or to participate in school -especially in homeschooling. However, emails are also associated with disadvantages such as spam, phishing, or malware. To engage children in security awareness we developed the DigiSkill platform, which provides interactive educational experiences. It consists of modules such as email or browser simulations, to increase the student's digital skills. In this research, we evaluated the tool with 52 secondary school students to observe their knowledge on security awareness in the context of email usage and to help gain a better understanding. Therefore, we conducted an in-class evaluation with a tool intervention and related pre- and post-activities. We observed different characteristics in emails that students use for classification and identified common misconceptions. We found that students follow an intensely visual approach, which means the visual representation of an email has a strong impact on the level of suspicion students have. We aim to provide educators with a tool to improve the security awareness skills of their students and to discuss educational possibilities in this field with our research findings.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of digital literacy is believed to be achieved through individual learning and improvements. This study explored the mutual relations between college students' learning approaches and digital literacy by using Self-determination theory (SDT). Structural equation modeling (SEM), part of a quantitative methodology, was designed with data collected through 639 students from three types of universities. SEM was used to verify the crucial indirect influence of SDT by comparing various effects of learning approaches. The results indicated that personal character, deep learning approach, autonomous and relational motivation significantly affect digital literacy. Firstly, age was an influential factor that surpassed various characteristics compared to gender and university type. Secondly, the more students were involved in the deep learning approach, the higher their digital literacy level, and deep learning has proven to significantly enhance their motivation such as autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Furthermore, among SDT, autonomy and relatedness were crucial factors in improving digital literacy, while competence's influence was relatively insignificant. Such results provide valuable insights into the motivational process of improving college students' digital literacy. We demonstrated that any university or society cannot develop its digital literacy in a conventional way. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

Though the use of educational technologies is an established practice in higher education institutions, its uptake seems to be varied. This chapter draws on a study of educational technologies (EdTechs) in different institutions within the South African higher education context to identify how various academic staff development units (for example, instructional designers in e-learning units) empower academics to integrate technologies in teaching and learning practices. In this chapter, the author analysed data by drawing on Archer's (1995) social realist framework. Data was obtained from an online survey (open-ended questionnaire) and interviews The findings from both data phases reveal a strong call for more theorised approaches in the use of EdTechs to promote digital literacies. In addition, academic development activities were valued as a driver to the uptake of these technologies. © 2022 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

Moreover, with the impact that the current pandemic has had on education, technology seems to be the only possible way to guarantee the continuity of teaching and learning. Considering that English is the most studied foreign language in Europe, it is necessary thus to analyse whether EFL teachers believe they are prepared for such a task and whether studying at a distance university improves their training in this respect. This study examines the perceptions of pre-service teachers of English studying at the Spanish National University of Distance Education regarding their digital literacy. Through a quasi-experimental, quantitative design, findings show that participants value their digital skills positively but consider they have not worked enough on their digital literacy despite studying at a distance university. Men show more positive self-perceptions than women, while respondents with less years of university experience value their digital skills more positively. Furthermore, respondents acknowledge not knowing how to assess or improve their digital literacy. The results suggest the need for distance universities like UNED to strengthen teacher training in digital skills. © 2022 The Open University.},

The paper summarizes selected findings and proposals for improvements related to the implementation of measures in selected areas of higher education institutions (HEI). The aim of the paper was to explore digital competency development in higher education institutions and factors with regard to university lecturers that affect the quality of the educational process in the context of the overall quality of graduates and labor market requirements. In addition, our study aims to fill an information gap and provide original data useful in the process of digital competency development in higher education. Methods/Analysis: The study employed an exploratory mixed-methods design. The data for this study is based on a survey with 24 open and closed questions and an analysis of 46 final thesis studies. Findings: Both the qualitative statements of the university lecturers and the survey shed light on the following: (1) (Re)creation of motivational factors; (2) Potential development of digital competencies; and (3) Supporting innovation in higher education. The results led to consideration of the educational process quality at the level of the subject and the object of education. Novelty/Improvement: The results point to the importance of investment in technology. This is related to improved educational outcomes and sustainable innovation in higher education. Slovak national education policymakers should provide innovative ways to increase the development of digital competencies in higher education institutions through the Recovery Plan for Europe; providing investment in technology related to improved educational outcomes and the development of sustainable innovation in higher education will all help to raise the standard. © 2022 by the authors.

The role of education is important in preparing would-be entrepreneurs with the right skill sets. Universities need to respond actively to this shift towards digitisation. Entrepreneur educators need to address this challenge by adjusting to the situation through the delivery of an experiential learning approach to students that incorporates a digital literacy curriculum. The question to consider here is the growing demand for alternative pedagogical view in entrepreneurship education and how entrepreneurial learning is delivered at Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, a public higher education institution in Malaysia. A case study approach was used to gather survey data with 304 entrepreneurial students. Digital literacy and experiential learning were used to form the conceptual framework of the phenomenon. The outcome posits that adopting a digital business project in an entrepreneurial course contributes towards an effective learning experience, perceived value in enhancing an entrepreneurial mindset and develops further digital skills among undergraduate students.

	abstract = {Women have a strategic role in managing and exploiting environmental potential. However, women particularly in tourism still face many obstacles in terms of capital resources, transformation and information, as well as the knowledge and skills of managing local potential. Through the action research method, this activity attempted to investigate whether digital literacy-based information technology can be used as an empowerment model for women in tourist villages. The study showed that technology may be used by women in tourist villages to expose their culinary products. This action was community based and it was found that it could trigger a group of women to continue learning and adapting with the current trends of marketing. The technology used to increase women’s skills in tourist villages was through the introduction and examples of several social media applications that can be used for tourist attraction. It can be concluded that women should be encouraged to be digitally literate and able to access a wide range of learning resources. © 2022, Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

Drawing on a common methodology, researchers studying children’s data literacy in Austria, Belgium, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Palau, Thailand, Tonga, the UK and the USA compare what they have learned. This chapter will draw out the common and culturally specific findings from five empirical projects to document children’s experiences and assess the challenges faced by educators. It is argued that, while children might benefit from educational efforts that treat them as able to construct norms on appropriate data usage and information flows, to try to resolve the privacy paradox by making educators responsible for mitigating the harms resulting from the structural problem of unfair data processing is to misdirect scarce educational resources. Only strong regulation with unambiguous obligations and accountability mechanisms will ensure that children around the world are not subjected to privacy violations and commercial exploitation in a digital age. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Luci Pangrazio, Julian Sefton-Green; individual chapters, the contributors.},

This study focused on technology integration in classroom activities, where data were collected from teachers, principals, and pedagogical center coordinators from secondary schools. Findings indicated a high rating for content, pedagogical, and pedagogical-content knowledge domains. Besides, all six knowledge domains, including technology, content, pedagogy, and their interactions, had a positive and significant relationship with the Technology-Pedagogical-Content Knowledge (TPACK) application. Results revealed that teachers' in-service training, attitude towards technology, technological and content knowledge, technology-pedagogical knowledge, and technological-content domains best predict TPACK application. Barriers to technology integration can be addressed through teachers' in-service professional development opportunities to enhance their confidence and competencies with technology. Besides, access to technological tools, administrative support, and expert mentoring and coaching on technology integration could increase digital technology uptake in the classroom, improving students' performance in this region. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: To build complex digital skills and capability required by digitally-driven work environments, we must first understand nursing students' baseline digital literacy if educators are to develop a fit for purpose curriculum underpinned by digital health technologies. Objective: To determine first-year pre-registration nursing students' perceived baseline digital literacy before their first clinical placement. Design: Prospective cohort study. Settings: Two universities in Australia in 2020. Participants: Students enrolled in pre-registration nursing programs at Bachelor's and Master's level. Methods: Participants (N = 205) completed an online 27-item survey composed of a Likert-type scale, forced-choice items, and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: Participants engaged with digital technology early in life, with 49.75% students using some form of digital technology before ten years of age. Students reported the highest daily use of technology to search the internet for information (92%), online social networking (68.3%) and watching videos (67%). Most students expressed the least confidence in identifying different types of portable storage devices (24.1% Master's students; 41.7% Bachelor's students), describing the advantages of a digital camera (39.3% Master's students; 48.3% Bachelor's students), and totaling numbers in spreadsheets (22.8% Masters students; 48.3% Bachelor's students). No statistical differences were observed between the two universities or the two cohorts in terms of perceived confidence in using technology and software applications to support their learning. Interestingly, 24.7% of participants expressed high confidence in using electronic medical records without prior training, which may reflect positive attitude towards engaging with unknown digital technologies. Conclusions: Nursing students are frequent internet and social media users. However, despite positive attitudes to digital technology and widespread presence of digital technology in students' lives, deficits in students' confidence in using digital technology and software required for learning persist. Targeted digital literacy education interventions are needed as part of foundational nursing studies to improve nursing students' baseline digital literacy before commencing clinical placement. These should be scaffolded across the program to ensure an effective transition to nursing practice in evolving digitally-driven healthcare environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The government has implemented the Digital Literacy Programme, distributing tablets to schools across the country, and also a new curriculum, promoting innovative teaching that includes digital literacy, learner-centered teaching, and relevance to students’ lives. Our purpose in this research was to explore culturally sustaining teaching methods in line with the Kenyan government’s push for innovative teaching and digital literacy attainment for all students. We used case study methods to describe Kenyan teachers’ perceptions of innovative teaching and digital literacy while participating in the Inquiry Initiative, a three-day professional development series. Participants included preschool, primary, and secondary teachers from Trans Nzoia County. Data sources were pre- and post-surveys, participant-generated artifacts, and interviews. Our participants perceived the following needs: new literacies for learners, creativity for learners, collaboration and group work, and creativity to overcome technological challenges. Overall, participants embraced learner-centered teaching theoretically but found that the lack of technological resources created barriers to teaching digital literacy in a learner-centered fashion. We found that teachers reported mostly using technology for teaching preparation and record keeping rather than engaging students in digital literacy practices. To solve technological challenges, teachers described having students work in groups and using smartphones. Future research could share more creative solutions to technical challenges in low-income countries. © 2021 The Authors.

This study is a mixed method that combines survey and pre-experimental research. The survey research was conducted through a quantitative approach using a questionnaire as the research instrument with assessed numerical items. The survey respondents consisted of 318 students from various universities in Indonesia who were taken through cluster random sampling technique. The implementation of the instrument was carried out through a pre-experimental design to 103 students to test the instrument's effectiveness. The confirmatory factor analysis result shows that the model forms three factors, which are factor 1 (communicating digital content), factor 2 (exploring digital content), and factor 3 (creating and using digital content). The result of the goodness of fit model shows that the instrument has met all the criteria with a value of X2/df = 1.642 (<3.00), RMSEA =.079 (≤.08), GFI =.900 (≥.90), AGFI =.825 (≥.90), TLI =.939 (≥.90), and CFI =.951 (≥.90). Empirically the instrument has good discrimination power so that it can measure students' digital literacy skills at different academic ability levels (Sig. <.05). In addition, the instrument has been effectively used to measure and predict student learning outcomes (R square =.255, Sig. <.05). The instruments' result is relevant to current conditions and can further explore students' digital literacy skills. © 2022 Eskisehir Osmangazi University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Learning to program is the new literacy of the 21st century. Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Therefore, this work considers this problem and presents an inclusive coeducation approach to this new literacy, eliminating gender stereotypes and extending them to people with Down syndrome and hospitalized minors.  © 2021 IEEE.},

The students are now required to have digital competencies to survive in the era of learning with technology; therefore, measuring the students' digital competencies is of utmost importance. This study evaluates the first-year university students' digital competencies at a higher education institute using a newly designed digital literacy measuring tool named digitlitfj. The digitlitfj is an online tool consisting of a 5 point Likert scale questionnaire ranging from 'No understanding' to 'Advanced level of understanding' that was piloted to the first-year university students. The results show that 86.15% of the students were average to very highly digitally literate. Also, Deep learning, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms in RapidMiner were used to evaluate the most important and influential variables in predicting an individual's digital literacy competency. The results show that all the variables utilized in the research were important, with computer literacy being the most influential variable in predicting an individual's digital literacy. © 2020 IEEE.},

The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the move to online learning has also increased the requirement for a reinvention of traditional teaching methodologies (Sá & Serpa, 2020). Methodology: A systematic review was conducted using a mix of Boolean search terms in twelve education and health journal databases to discover the extent of current international research of digital literacy in health programmes. Papers were selected for their specificity to digital literacy in health education pre-registration professional programmes. Results: The initial search included 5359 papers, 3925 after duplicates removed, 134 remained after title review which were then input into Covidence for full reading, finally 47 papers being included for thematic analysis. This thematic analysis identified a number of key themes within these papers: Digital literacy of the educator, digital literate workforce, technical skills limit adoption, information literacy, a curriculum requirement in education, institutional infrastructure or personal access, preparedness for entering academia, concerns over the use of digital skills, personalised digital literacy experience, increased communication skills with digital literacies, competency frameworks, COVID-19 and social media in education. Conclusion: This research identifies areas of good practice and areas that need to be considered in higher education programmes and by academics to ensure the digital literacy of the future healthcare workforce. © 2021 by the authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas.},

The article reports on a study which drew on elicited data from Facebook users to explore their critical awareness of the communicative norms and social networks shaping their use of the site. Our analysis makes two key contributions. Firstly, we theorise the connection between our interviewees’ online practices and their critical language/media awareness through the concept of context design, which explains the dynamic ways in which people frame their interactions, based on unfolding understandings of the social space. Secondly, in tackling issues around disinformation and political polarisation, we highlight the need for critical digital literacies programmes at higher education institutes, which typically focus on information literacies, to take account of the social or interpersonal nature of much contemporary internet use. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

Consequently, if teachers are responsible for providing students with opportunities for the best learning experiences so that they can discover their potential and put their skills into practice, it seems evident that the competences of these professionals cannot be overlooked. Research is profuse when analyzing the teachers' digital literacy in different contexts, including in-service and pre-service ones in areas such as English as a Foreign Language and bilingual education. However, it is necessary to examine how future teachers view their digital competence in hybrid education settings derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the self-perceived digital competence of a group of pre-service primary teachers of English and bilingual education studying at the University of Córdoba (Spain) that have received hybrid education during the 2020/21 academic year. A quasi-experimental design and a quantitative approach based on the use of a questionnaire are followed. Findings show that surveyed teachers show general positive attitudes in relation to their digital literacy, and gender differences are only statistically significant when considering self-perceived competence in terms of searching, accessing, and selecting online content for teaching purposes in favor of men. It seems clear that specific training is still needed among future teachers of English and bilingual education in this respect. © 2021 IEEE.},

In light of this, and to improve the public health skills of professionals working to promote health education, one of the current priorities is to train pre-service teachers on how to search for health-related scientific knowledge relating to bio-health through digital literacy in health. The objectives of this study were to determine the level of eHealth literacy, scientific knowledge in health and confidence on the part of students, analyzing the degree of improvement following a teaching intervention with students of the Bachelor’s Degree of Education of the University of Extremadura. A quasi-experimental longitudinal study was carried out with pre-test and post-test groups and a mixed data analysis. It involved the application of an active cooperative methodology with tutoring using the jigsaw technique, with the use of four quality digital browsers to enhance scientific rigor. The results show that the initial level of eHealth literacy and confidence was problematic. Following the intervention with the cooperative methodology, both these levels and the level of scientific knowledge in health reached an excellent level. In conclusion, this suggests that university training programs need to be implemented to improve digital and scientific skills in health education as they are currently insufficient. It has been demonstrated that a cooperative active methodology im-proved these levels and accordingly its use in active and digital higher education should be pro-moted. © 2021 by the authors.

The last variable, reserved for the academic field under study, directly addresses the main objective as regards tourism. The results show a great global and multidisciplinary interest in digital literacy (DL), mainly from students. There is also a parallel between the integration of ICT into society and the growing evolution of case studies, as well as little interest in their development in specific areas such as tourism studies.

Among the different forms of educational leadership, transformational leadership is recognized as the most appropriate for application in higher education, as it focuses on the division of leadership among academics with different skills in order to manage in a collective way the range of leadership duties required in different contexts. Methods/Analysis: This view is also reflected in this research paper, which focused on the degree of three specific forms of leadership (transformational leadership, transactional leadership, and leadership to be avoided) by members of the Senate of the University of Peloponnese. Descriptive and inductive methods of statistical analyses were applied for the interpretation of results. Findings: Notably, the findings indicate that leadership outcome has a strong positive correlation with transformational leadership and negative correlation with passive-to avoid leadership, confirming that higher transformational leadership implies greater efficiency and satisfaction for employees. Novelty/Improvement: A high degree of passive leadership coexists with the corresponding negative degree of implementation of digital leadership. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.},

Digital literacy is known to be the key to success in online learning. While nomophobia is a threat on the other hand. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a comparative study of the level of digital literacy and nomophobia in students as participants in online learning. This study is a descriptive with a quantitative approach. The study was carried out in 3 stages, namely (1) preparation of instruments for measuring digital literacy and nomophobia, (2) data collection, and (3) measuring digital literacy and nomophobia. Respondents of this study were 234 students of University of Nahdlatul Ulama Surabaya and several other universities who are participants in online learning. The results showed that most of the respondents had high levels of digital literacy and nomophobia. There are no respondents who are not nomophobic and have a low level of digital literacy. So it can be concluded that online learning has the opportunity to increase digital literacy, but on the other hand there is also a threat of increasing nomophobia.  © 2021 IEEE.},

This research studies the use of ICTs, especially the Internet, by university students in Hispanic countries. The methodology used is descriptive and quantitative, based on data mining, through a validated and highly reliable instrument. The sample was composed of students from six countries (N = 1893). The results show that the primary interests in using ICTs and the Internet are primarily for consuming social networks, obtaining information, and leisure, above and beyond their use for academic and university purposes. This indicates that there is still a lack of sufficient training for the optimal use of these technologies by higher education students. It is urgent to carry out digital literacy processes that allow them to develop a critical sense in using ICTs, nowadays configured as powerful means of communication. Furthermore, this study has been determined that the Hispanic common space has solid cultural roots and everyday practices that lead to quite similar general interests. © 2021 Academic Publishing House Researcher s.r.o.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION. The inclusion of the digital competence in the training curriculums of university students is necessary because of the changes experienced in society due to the digitization of all its fields. Students must acquire the necessary skills and abilities to use the technological resources that allow them to function freely within the digital age. To promote its development, universities implement active methodologies where the student becomes the protagonist of the teaching-learning process. Among these methodological proposals is gamification. METHOD. This work presents the results obtained on the development of the digital teaching competence, taking into account its five dimensions, in the student bodies of the Degree of Social Education (ES) and the Degree of Physical Activity and Sport Science (CAFD), using a gamified project as a methodological strategy. A Quantitative research of a quasi-experimental nature has been carried out with repeated pretest-postest measures without a control group. The sample consists of 86 students (48 ES and 38 CAFD). 44.9% are men and 55.1% are women and the participants belong to the age groups that range from 18 to 25. RESULTS. The results show that, after intervention through the implementation of gamification, all values in the five dimensions of the digital teaching competence (digital literacy, communication, collaboration, content creation, security and problem solving) increase considerably. DISCUSSION. The study concludes that when the development of the digital skills are promoted through active learning strategies such as gamification, the results are favorable in all its items, regardless of the sex or the degree studied. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.},

With this basis, education should be able to develop superior knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values to deal with the industrial revolution 4.0. Currently the world is facing a big problem, namely the corona virus. Indonesia is among the countries that have found many positive cases of the corona virus. The government is making efforts to reduce the spread of the corona virus by carrying out social restrictions. The government makes regulations to work from home. In the world of education known as online schools. Physics Learning uses various types of teaching materials. Teaching materials integrating STEM which can be accessed by teachers and students anytime and anywhere, will assist students in answering challenges in the 21st century and responding to online schools. The purpose is to describe the STEM components contained in the XI grade XI high school physics teaching materials. The method is descriptive method with data collection instruments namely observation sheets. The results of the analysis of teaching materials show that science and mathematics indicators are more dominant in Physics teaching materials, but indicators of engineering and technology have not been seen. Thus, the existence of Physics teaching materials integrating STEM has not been maximized, therefore it is necessary to design a teaching material integrating STEM in Physics learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The databases used for this purpose were “Web of Science” and “Scopus.” The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the academic literature was based on the most significant scientific studies (374 articles) and the most relevant bibliometric indicators from 1997 to 2020. The study was complemented with a qualitative approach to detect the use and evolution of digital literacy, particularly in English language education, and to identify the methodological trends and different lines of research in applied linguistics. The findings revealed that the most popular articles dealing with digital literacy and the English language increased in the period from 2011 to 2019. Further exploration addressed a gap in the research literature in the year prior to 1997. In addition, while the more cited studies had a significant presence in the research fields of linguistics and educational research, the more recent papers offered a future perspective providing evolutionary contexts not only in digital but in multimodal literacy and English language education. The review sought to answer these questions: What is the evolution of digital literacy in English language education and its correspondence with active learning approaches that are supported by Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL)?

	abstract = {Teaching digital literacies as social practices is challenging for many English as an Additional Language (EAL) practitioners. There is not much research that offers effective approaches and specific examples. Drawing on the ‘3D’ model (Green [2002]. “A Literacy Project of Our Own.” English in Australia 134: 25–32), this exploratory study developed, implemented and evaluated a suitable pedagogic approach for teaching digital literacies–experiential digital storytelling. We examined its potential for EAL settings from the teacher-participant’s perspective using her reflective journal, her evaluation of student work, and an interview. The analysis suggests that using experiential digital storytelling enabled the teacher to extend most students’ learning beyond technical skills and develop their understanding of the complex relationships between language, technology, audience, context, social goals and power although some EAL students needed additional time and support. When designed with relevant theoretical constructs, experiential digital storytelling offers practitioners new possibilities to engage students in complex transliteracies practices in which meanings shift and change over time, space, relationships and resources. By conceptualising this new approach and providing a specific example of a learning unit, this study makes a conceptual and practical contribution to the field of language learning and teaching. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The text aims to understand digital literacy from the perspective of lifelong education, based on the humanistic perspective of the concept. The exponential technological advance and the growth of the population of elderly people in Brazil and in the world make the need to discuss the digital inclusion of this age group, as well as the idea of an education that lasts throughout the process of living. Digital inclusion directly impacts the full exercise of citizenship by contemporary social subjects, since the hypermedia languages of cyberspace permeate a lot of social practices. In this context, the article seeks discussion between four concepts: lifelong learning, digital inclusion, digital literacy and empowerment (in the freiriana sense of the term). It is considered that digital inclusion is understood as one of the facets of the social inclusion of the elderly, due to its relevant role, in the achievement of their autonomy and their full exercise of citizenship. The concepts presented here - digital literacy of the elderly, lifelong learning and empowerment - seek to provide conceptual arguments to better understand the possible contributions of digital inclusion, in a society marked by the strengthening of hypermedia languages along with contemporary social practices. © 2021 UNIVERSIDADE FEEVALEÂ.

Therefore, the proper way of teaching and learning digital literacy requires personalized learning. Nowadays, the ethnic minority group can have equal access to a vast opportunity from the Internet through the smartphone. However, the Internet can also be harmful to them without proper protection. Therefore, it is necessary to promote digital literacy for them. This study proposes a smart learning environment for enhancing digital literacy of Thai youths from the ethnic minority group. The proposed smart environment modifies the objective distance, which is the distance between the satisfied and the current competency of each learner, for providing a personal learning path. There are 5 learning objects included. The experiment is conducted with 103 students who are the ethnic minority group in Chiang Rai province, Thailand. The comparison of post-test and pre-test reveals that the students can enhance their digital literacy after learning with the developed learning environment. Overall, the students agree on the provided personalized support. More specifically, they strongly agree that the provided content is suitable for their performances. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The focus of this study was to identify profile of student's higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and digital literacy among junior high school students in science learning. Mixed method, a combination of quantitative and qualitative was used in this study. A total number of 170 of grade 7th students in private and public junior high school in Semarang City were administered in the integrated science test (IST). IST were used to measure student's HOTS through constructed-multiple choice test. 17 science teachers were the key informant of HOTS and digital literacy in science learning. Rasch model and descriptive analysis used to identify HOTS and digital literacy based on gender and type of school. The results reveal that : (1) most of junior high school students HOTS performace were at low slight to moderate level (2) female students performs better than male students in HOTS, (3) type of school significantly impact on students' achievement, and (4) teachers' operation and thinking skills as basic skill of digital literacy were still unsufficient to provide digital-based learning. However, it is necessary to accustom implementation of HOTS assessment as well as digital technology in the science learning environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This phenomenon not only exhibits the inability to perform basic fact checking, but also the lack of critical thinking. Digital literacy is needed to assist people in applying critical thinking as they consume information and make use of the information to leverage their quality of life. Regardless of various curriculums and activities designed to impart digital literacy in Indonesia, notable weaknesses appear after a period of usage. First, the design of the digital literacy curriculum is merely based on text and the classical approach of teaching. Hence, it falls short of contextualising the learning for a larger audience outside of the school environment. Second, the digital literacy curriculum applies only for general situations. There has been insufficient instruction on how to apply it in specific contexts. A literature review pertaining to enable people to acquire digital literacy skills resulted in a novel training that should be developed to match such a need. This curriculum demands for new training themes, along with an approach that should be exercised to contextualise a digital literacy curriculum that matches Indonesia’s circumstances. © SEARCH Journal 2021.},

The data on which the study is based were collected using an ethnographic methodology, including classroom observations and individual semi-structured interviews with the student and her teacher. Literacy is understood from a social practices perspective; the analysis explores interacting aspects of literacy events and practices. It was found that the learner has limited opportunities to participate in digital literacy practices in her everyday life and that most of these involve social interaction with family and friends. The teacher in the SFI programme encourages her only in limited ways to engage in digital literacy practices, though she and the student do engage in digital literacy practices of a semi-private nature. I suggest that learners’ digital literacy practices can be brought to bear for pedagogical purposes to better connect to the learner’s transnational practices and for the teacher to understand the learner’s entire linguistic repertoire and range of literacies for learning. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The sphere of science and research, especially comparative education research, is being inevitably affected. The dizzying pace of socio-economic changes complicated by COVID-19 pandemic made it obvious that we are dealing with the digitisation of shock, rather than phased, character. The article states the lack of serious scientific reflection on the currently witnessed “shock digitisation” of science, complicated with growing digital illiteracy of researchers. The latter is demonstrated through rigorous literature review and SciVal Scopus analytics. The article is concluded with the idea that the field of comparative education research requires future profound rethinking of assumptions and agenda priorities in several aspects.

For instance, companies are making their operations smarter by adopting digital technologies such as big data analytics, industrial internet of things, etc. to gain valuable insights from their existing business processes. IR 4.0 technologies serve as an enabler to empower the next wave of business growth by providing efficient delivery of products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Such a scenario has resulted in the rising demand of workforce that are not only field competent but also possess the essential digital skills in order to cope with the fast-changing needs of the industry. From the educational perspective, the aforementioned phenomenon has led to the pressing need to nurture digital competency for both educators and students, which is further accelerated due to the global pandemic of coronavirus disease. In this chapter, we wish to highlight the importance of digital competency in ensuring a sustainable, future-proof technical education in coping with the needs of future workplace. In particular, we wish to focus on how professional digital competency can be developed through the adoption of open educational resources (OER) and open-source software (OSS). The status quo of the digitalization shift in both industry and academia will be discussed in the introduction section, followed by a critical discussion on the recent progress pertaining digital competency, OER, and OSS. By proposing a framework and suggestions on how to bridge the gap among digital competency, OER and OSS shall be presented with recommendations for future works. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Muhammad Mujtaba Asad, Fahad Sherwani, Razali Bin Hassan, and Prathamesh Churi; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {English Language Teaching (ELT) is part of a teaching and learning activity focused on English development. The ELT's distance learning enactment is used for English communication. These activities may be linked to digital literacy practices, particularly for Chinese students as non-native speakers, in stimulating English as regular communication in spoken and written centered on communication. From distance learning, some Chinese ICUTK students have contributed a lot to using English to teach and practice contact at any time. Running digital literacy practices as an ELT approach and strategy will help improve English skills in the era of Industrial Revolution 4.0, especially by enacting distance learning from China Mainland to Thailand. The purpose of this research is to know how well students can learn ELT. It describes how essential social media platforms are in delivering ELT lessons for distance learning countries between Thailand and the People's Republic of China and how Chinese students practice digital literacy through media apps synchronously and asynchronously. This study uses a qualitative approach focused on classroom learning. Simultaneously, researchers learn how useful ELT activity for Chinese students through asynchronous and synchronous methods such as WeChat apps and Ding Talks apps. These online platforms demonstrate how effective distance learning for Chinese students in the ELT is and how useful a forum is to help teach and learn in English. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The generation born in the early 2000s, namely the Z-generation, is a generation born at a time when technology is so rapidly developing and the beginning of the emergence and development of social media the passion of all generations. Psychologically, this condition makes this Z-generation to have its own personality, psyche and character which is different from previous generations who do not have the postmodern environment setting. It is certainly impossible to educate them with the same educational methods as conventional educational media. For Z-generation their world has become two realms of the world, namely the real world and the virtual world, their virtual world has been set up the same as the real world, there they play, joke, learn, gather, this situation which sometimes makes the portion of their virtual world far away. The purpose of this study was to determine the urgency of students’ digital literacy and provide insights related to information retrieval to support classroom learning, especially Islamic religious education. This research is a qualitative research using descriptive analysis techniques with library research. The results of this study reveal that social media is a medium of Islamic religious learning that is relevant in educating Z-generation. The use of social media as a learning medium and student supervision is the right step considering that the Z-generation is actually very familiar with social media, even the portion of their virtual world is sometimes bigger than the portion of their real world. © 2021},

The study was commissioned by the Ministry of National Education and was conducted in 2018 in Poland, and involved a group of 484 teachers. The goal of the research was to present the teachers’ knowledge and skills related to digital threats in the areas of the assessment of the reliability of information, sexting, cyberbullying, intellectual property rights, the protection of online images, and protection against malware. Digital literacy (DL) was measured using a knowledge and competence test and a diagnostic survey. The ability to enter the LLL process thanks to the ongoing advancement of ICT increases the online safety of all of the school-related stakeholders. A detailed analysis of the results also revealed that the teachers obtained good results in the test in terms of their knowledge about sexting and image protection but scored poorly regarding copyright and the assessment of the reliability of online information; male teachers know more about the technical aspects of digital safety than female teachers; trainees need particular support in the form of informal and non-formal education. © 2021 International Review of Finance Ltd.},

New terms have entered the use of daily language: social distancing, self-quarantine, the digital divide, etc. In the field of education, the outbreak of COVID19 forced schools worldwide to close, parents to work at home, and students to attend virtual classes. We now talk of online teaching, distance learning, hybrid learning, and remote learning transition. This paper aims at studying whether these changes mark digital literacy via studying Lebanese high-school students’ perception of online learning under COVID-19 lockdown. A questionnaire of 10 items aiming to identify the students’ educational psychological, social and emotional reactions to the online experience was distributed to EFL Lebanese high-school students in different areas in Lebanon. One hundred and twenty four students reacted to the questionnaire. Fifteen of these were interviewed to share an open-ended discussion on the second academic year of online learning. Based on the findings, the conclusion was made on whether we are living in the age of digital literacy. © 2021, Arab Open University - Lebanon. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The increasing digitalization of medicine stressed the importance of teaching digital competencies in undergraduate medical education. However, in many medical curricula in Germany, medical informatics is underrepresented. Due the upcoming reorganization of medical undergraduate education in Germany, topics previously assigned to medical informatics represent curricular challenges for all medical disciplines. Against this background, experiences from the project DigiWissMed show how medical informatics can support the teaching of digital competencies in all disciplines of medical education. Therefore, interdisciplinary teaching teams of medical informatics professionals and physicians were formed. In different academic years, this teaching teams jointly designed and implemented new seminars to convey digital competencies. The seminars covers topics such as technology acceptance, telemedicine and assistive health care related to the medical specialty. So, in the project DigiWissMed, the practicability and usefulness of interdisciplinary teaching teams to convey digital competencies could be demonstrate. In the digitalization process of medicine, medical informatics plays a key role. For future-proof medical education, experts of this field should be involved in teaching digital competencies, too. © 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press. © 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

The research instruments were data collection at the end of the lessons, which included information on Academic Achievement and Digital Literacy Ability assessment. Means, standard deviations and one-way MANOVA statistics were computed. As the results, the experimental group had higher Digital Literacy Abilities than the control group (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the groups for Academic Achievement.

	abstract = {Purpose/Significance]The implementation of digital literacy education is significant for public libraries to adapt to the development of Digital China and narrow the digital divide. Investigating the practice of digital literacy education in American public libraries can provide some references to us.[Design/Methodology]This paper surveyed the websites of 50 American state libraries, and selected eight of them as the research sample. An analysis was conducted on their digital literacy education programs, subjects and contents, as well as the methods. [Findings/Conclusion]There are several characteristics in American state libraries' digital literacy education, including emphasis on collaboration in digital literacy education programs, well organization of instruction resources, satisfying hierarchical public needs, and multiple patterns both online and offline. Accordingly, Chinese public libraries need to strengthen collaboration with stakeholders in designing or participating the education programs, integrate and well organize educational resources, provide progressive themes and contents according to the hierarchy of user needs, use reasonable methods and allocate practical space based on developing networkinfrastructure and digital equipment, and strengthen instructors' training and pay attention to users' feedback.[Originality/ Value]This research explores public libraries' digital literacy education programs, contents and methods from the perspective of educational system, as well as stakeholders' cooperation, which will help optimize the educational system and public digital literacy level. © 2021 Editorial Office of Documentation, Information and Knowledge.

	abstract = {While teacher-as-methodology-researcher paradigm in the area of methodology is quite firmly established, teacher-as-language-researcher is less common, especially in teacher training programmes. Much less emphasis is placed on equipping teachers (especially non-natives) with skills of language analysis, hypothesis posing, data retrieval and analysis. The use of ready-made language corpora in preparing classroom data and creating materials is still inadequately covered in teacher training programmes, let alone putting future teachers in the shoes of linguistic researchers observing the changing face of English. The purpose of this paper is to present a case for promoting teacher-as-language-researcher attitudes in the graduate teacher training programme. A case study is presented, in which student teachers were gradually introduced into New Englishes, through existing corpora, text retrieval and compilation, and – finally – do-it-yourself concordancing. The data from questionnaires and teacher diaries will illuminate upon the viability of self-made corpus compilations as a part of 21st century digital literacy. © 2021 Elsevier Doyma.

	abstract = {Chemistry learning is faced with problems that emphasize students'difficulty in learning the basic chemistry concepts to become increasingly difficult and less meaningful. Digital literacy can understand chemistry concepts and develop critical thinking skills because digital literacy emphasizes reading, writing, understanding, evaluating, communicating, and using the information in different formats. This research aims to determine digital literacy's role and urgency for generation Z students in chemistry learning. This research is descriptive qualitative research. The research subjects were chemistry education students of FSTT of Universitas Pendidikan Mandalika. In this study, there were two types of data; primary and secondary data. The primary data was collected through direct observation and interviews. Secondary data was collected through the literature review. The results showed that digital literacy is needed in chemistry learning by focusing on Generation Z students' needs in accessing the Internet as a medium to promises ease of community connectivity, starting from how to communicate, collaborate, be creative, solve problems, make decisions, and consume information. In chemistry learning, digital technology can help improve chemistry teaching quality in technical, cognitive, and social aspects. Also, digital technology has become necessary in chemistry learning because it can help students learn better with various ICT-enabled features that can motivate understanding of chemistry concepts and reduce cognitive memory load when studying ICT-based chemistry. Thus, digital literacy is urgent for Generation Z students in chemistry learning. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

For assessing our proposed hypotheses, an online survey was conducted with 238 teaching staff from different departments of universities in Malaysia. Using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), our analysis revealed that all the proposed components (i.e., technology literacy, knowledge deepening, presentation skills, and professional skills) of digital competency significantly influenced the TTF. The Task-Technology Fit was also found as an influential construct, which positively and significantly affected both Moodle’s utilization and teachers’ task performance. Besides, Moodle’s utilization was confirmed to be a substantial determinant of the performance impact. In the end, this study included limitations and future directions based on how the study’s contribution can support academics and practitioners for assessing and understanding what particular components of digital competency impact TTF, which in turn may influence the system’s utilization and performance impact. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, few studies have examined students’ attitudes toward Web 2.0 PLEs or, more specifically, the factors influencing students’ positive attitudes or willingness toward Web 2.0 PLEs. This study investigates the effects of self-regulating capabilities (e.g., metacognition and time management), tool literacy, and information literacy on preservice teachers’ attitudes toward using Web 2.0 for constructing their PLEs. Participants included 137 undergraduate students in education at a large Midwestern university in the United States, who completed a survey focused on: (1) attitudes toward building a Web 2.0 PLE; (2) metacognitive self-regulation; (3) time and study environment; (4) tool literacy; and (5) information literacy. Results indicated that tool literacy and metacognitive self-regulating capabilities had predictive effects on preservice teachers’ attitudes regarding building PLEs with Web 2.0 tools. The findings of this research offer meaningful implications for researchers and educators about which essential competencies need to be fostered before students are asked to build their own Web 2.0 PLE. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The expansion of digital technologies in all spheres of human life determines the digital transformation of education. This is due to the fact that the digital transformation of education brings the educational system itself in line with the requirements of the technological revolution and allows students to obtain relevant digital competencies in order to be qualified personnel for the economic sector. In connection with the digitalization of education and the active use of information technologies in the educational process, the requirements to the faculty of higher education are also changing. This became especially noticeable over the past year, when universities worked in a remote format. Therefore, the authors of the article turn to the issue of digital literacy of modern higher education teachers. Based on the structurally functional theory of T. Parsons, the modernist concept of E. Giddens and the theory of determination of human behavior by A. Maslow, it is shown what competencies a modern higher education teacher has in the context of the digital transformation of education. Based on the analysis, it should be noted that digital competencies include competencies related to information literacy, skills for interaction in an electronic environment; the ability to generate digital content; ensuring the safety of the physical and psychological health of users; the ability to identify and eliminate technical problems when working with digital devices. Digital literacy of teachers is the mastery of a set of the listed competencies. In general, the digital literacy index of university teachers is quite high, but unlike young people, teachers trust technological innovations to a lesser extent, which reduces their willingness to actively work with the digital educational environment. In our opinion, modern teachers need to transform their attitude to digitalization with the help of high-quality training in working with a digital educational environment. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.},

	abstract = {Digitalization has become popular across various industries including construction. Construction industry involves unique outputs, complex processes and multi-disciplinary engagements. Digitization has introduced in the industry from electronic documents, email communication to automation and concepts such as Building Information Modelling (BIM). Construction professionals should possess sets of skills to cope with complex nature in the industry whilst conquering this modern digital era. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has proposed a set of digital literacy competencies for youth and adults in their 'Digital Literacy Global Framework'. Meanwhile, some professional bodies in construction also have acknowledged Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills as core to their professionals. In this vein, digital literacy will be a competitive advantage for construction management graduates. Digital literacy practices are not emerging spontaneously but, education plays an important role in this context. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are widespread among higher education providers for both face-to-face and online offerings. LMS are tailored to cater various pedagogical strategies and can also be used to enrich digital literacy of students. This paper maps how the digital literacy competences proposed by UNESCO are addressed with online activities and resources used in first year courses in a construction management degree program operating in an online educational environment in Australia facilitated through Moodle Learning Management System. The core competencies recognized by major construction professional bodies were considered as the 'Career-related competences' in the UNESCO framework. The paper also presents which of the online activities are mostly implemented and engaged in the selected courses and which of the core competencies are mostly addressed. Findings suggest 'Assignment', 'Forum' and 'Quiz' as the mostly implemented and engaged activities, whereas 'Glossary' activity with less implementation but, higher engagement so, with a higher potential of addressing digital competencies. Information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation and career-related competency of using standard computer packages are the mostly addressed competencies. © ICCE 2020 - 28th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

When Austria implemented the mandatory curriculum 'Digital Education' in September 2018 for all students in lower secondary education, digital literacy finally found its official way into additional grades. The curriculum covers digital competences, media competences, as well as civic education. Schools can decide if they offer stand-alone subjects or if they implement the curriculum in an integrative way in several other subjects. This paper reports on first experiences with the new curriculum by evaluating a survey conducted approximately two years after the implementation. Aiming to do so, the qualitative data were interpreted, summarized, and discussed, while the quantitative data were analyzed in former papers. The study was sent to 133 local public schools, whereas 117 teachers were willing to complete the questionnaire and 39 filled out the comment section. The following research questions lay out the basis for the evaluation of the qualitative data: 1) How do teachers manage the implementation of the new curriculum? 2) What is the teachers' opinion on the current situation?

	abstract = {This Research-to-Practice Full Paper discusses the use of the active learning approach to enhance the 21st century skills that are critical to developing new job opportunities for young engineers. The soft skills required in the Fourth Industrial Revolution make the traditional mode of logical-scientific thinking insufficient for the degree of innovation and disruption required in future jobs. In the field of higher engineering education, the situation was doubly challenging: Generation Z students' cognitive skills had to be improved in terms of digital literacy and cutting-edge technological tools had to be quickly incorporated. This work is a study on the effectiveness of the didactic approach of Active Learning in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) and the innovative ways of empowering students to develop digital literacy skills, among them: photo-visual ability, reproduction ability, branching ability, real-time critical thinking ability and, the most important of this study, socio-emotional ability. The opportunities and challenges that the study addressed were related to accessibility, inclusion, and self-paced learning. The research was carried out with a mixed experimental methodology in a sample of 352 engineering students, who were evaluated with different types of instruments to know the level of acquisition of soft skills related to digital literacy. To evaluate these skills, different assessing instruments were used for pre-tests and post-tests, including: vocabulary level, lateral thinking ability, fluency and originality; as well as story-articulation skill tests and modified VALUE rubrics from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU). The results obtained showed that the active learning approach promoted a better understanding of scientific concepts in engineering subjects, a greater ability to develop digital communication skills, and a greater awareness of creative thinking skill.  © 2021 IEEE.},

It is based on the observation that the adolescent practice of fanfiction fosters the development of literary and numerical skills and that it presents common characteristics with traditional literary and even academic writing practices. In this sense, it may have relevant didactic potential. However, bringing informal practices closer to the school setting is a risk as they might then lose their appeal and no longer make it possible to thwart negative relationships with the written word. We will analyze whether or not the fanfiction experiment, carried out over the course of a school year, has been able to stimulate the students’ commitment and positively change their relationship to the written word. © 2021 Universite Stendhal, Editions Litteraires et Linguistiques de l'Universite de Grenoble (ELLUG).

Since finding and using online texts and using various programs and applications that require search and evaluation skills to do work are typical for online learning, it follows that part of parent responsibilities in many families might involve using basic technological literacies or even more advanced digital ones. To focus on the range of technological literacies that parents employ, researchers gathered self-report data from parents about how they engage with online education technologies while working with their children with disabilities. Interviews with (n = 32) parents across six states in the West, Midwest, and Southern United States revealed that parents employ various skills with a specific set of purposes in mind. Literacies were used to (a) perform basic technological computing tasks, (b) evaluate information to supplement existing instructional materials, and (c) communicate with the school about children’s needs. Reported purposes for using these skills emerged as (a) instructing, (b) monitoring, (c) advocating, and (d) learning school expectations. Implications of this study include the potential for literacy-based approaches to parent preparation for supporting vulnerable children in online settings. © 2021, The Online Learning Consortium.

The test results were a reality check for the developer team and provided key points for further development. The paper will describe the test process, divided into plan, results and actions for further development of the mobile application. The application is for use by educators in secondary schools. The application introduces basic methods for teaching digital literacy and production and provides examples of concrete learning designs. It is a huge challenge to teach digital literacy and production in secondary schools. It can be demanding to meet learning goals, plan meaningful activities and at the same time apply emerging digital tools. The application was inspired by game-based learning ideas: for example, we visualized didactical concepts using Augmented Reality (AR). The emerging AR technology combined the physical surroundings and virtual elements. Didactical concepts can be quite abstract for a new educator and the visualizations make them more familiar. The application was developed as part of a funded project exploring AR in teaching and learning in upper secondary schools in the Southern Region of Denmark. The application titled in Danish ROBOdidaktik (robo-didactics) can be downloaded from Appstore and Play store. © The Authors, 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

The set of skills and competences integrating digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education. During the lockdown globally imposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive changes. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three countries’ higher education institutions (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador), analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation, focusing on the development of digital literacy. The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratory-correlational scope using a questionnaire designed ad hoc and applied in a sample of 376 students. Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such as the teacher’s digital skills, sources for learning that may be adapted, communication between universities and students, and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context. Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this transformation, mainly: communication, teaching, and digital competences. Otherwise, digital literacy is not being guaranteed, which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The European Commission, in the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027. Reconfiguring education and training for the digital age (2020) underlines the need to exploit the potential of digital technologies for learning and teaching and develop digital skills for all. In this digital age, education plays an essential role in modifying society, as does technology. Together they comprise a fundamental dimension of social change, since the evolution and transformation of societies are built through the complex interaction of cultural, economic, political and technological factors. In this framework, the objectives that guided this research were to capture and compare the perceptions of private higher education students (university and polytechnic) about remote learning and analyse the impact of this teaching modality on socioemotional and digital skills. To do this study, the methodology used was the construction and application of a questionnaire to 1st year students of different fields of study from two private higher education institutions. The sample was purposive (Creswell, 2014). Data were collected via online questionnaire, composed of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. The results of this study show that the imposed confinement measures affected the way of being, learning and teaching. And that the surveyed students show similarity in terms of socio-emotional skills but divergence in terms of digital skills. The vast majority of students surveyed are in favour of a clear focus on hybrid education. From this research, of exploratory nature, we can conclude that the use of technologies, explored in online classes, represent a great possibility to boost post-pandemic education, and that digital skills are strategi-cally important in the context of ecological and digital transitions. © 2021, Edicoes Universitarias Lusofonas.

This year, exceptionally, as a result of the global health emergency generated by Covid-19, education, like all other sectors of society, has been forced to implement a distance communication system aided by digital technologies for effective connectivity. It is in this scenario where lack of competence and abilities have been seen in students, having to adapt to these new virtual classroom conditions. The objective of this study is to diagnose gaps in access to ICTs and the level of technological knowledge present in public education students in the Ñuble region, Chile. The research utilizes the quantitative method, analyzing the objective reality by means of a survey-questionnaire type instrument, to collect quantifiable data and carry out the corresponding statistical analysis. The results show that more than 50% of the participants can conduct themselves in the digital field, perform basic functions to surf the internet and carry out school work. However, 47% dedicate a significant time of their attention and connectivity, in social networks, through the mobile phone, even exceeding seven hours a day. The conclusions focus on the importance of integrating, in all public educational establishments, sufficient digital literacy to ensure quality and equitable access to knowledge for all students. © 2021 Interciencia Association.

	abstract = {Despite the fact that many contemporary school curricula envisage students creating multimodal texts with digital resources in all curriculum disciplines, there is widespread concern that schools have failed to prepare students for the digital literacy demands of study and work beyond school. One explanation for this problem lies with teachers’ capacity to teach the digital skills necessary for students’ success. This chapter focuses on the preparedness of preservice teachers (PSTs) to teach digital literacy in school science. The chapter describes an intervention designed by university-based teacher educators in which PSTs constructed short digital artifacts explaining science concepts for young learners. The intervention - which drew on key concepts from systemic functional theory and emergent theories of multimodality - is described in terms of the pedagogic decisions made and exemplifies the theoretical approach with reference to a student artifact produced after the intervention. The data, together with the PST’s account of the construction process, shed light on the challenges of such tasks in terms of disciplinary knowledge and semiotic awareness. The chapter argues for a theoretically principled approach to meta-semiotic knowledge that will provide teachers with much-needed tools to deliver curricula as anticipated. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Maria Grazia Sindoni and Ilaria Moschini; individual chapters, the contributors.},

To achieve this goal a mixed investigation was designed in which two data collection techniques were used. In addition, three discussion groups were developed in several Spanish universities aimed at understanding what meanings teachers attributed to the type of skills that were being put into practice in the development of innovative educational processes in which mobile devices were being used. This article presents the results of a questionnaire in which a sample of 155 teachers from different Spanish universities participated. All the teachers involved had participated in teaching innovation processes with mobile devices. The results suggest that university teachers possess digital skills that enable them to use mobile devices for the selection of digital resources. The participating teachers suggest that, beyond the devices used, the innovative nature of the experiences is related to the way in which these are involved in projects designed for innovation and improvement, taking full advantage of their potential for communication and access to information. © 2021 Universidad de Sevilla.

	abstract = {Purpose: Distance education gained key importance in the field of education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A new era has begun for educators and students in higher education with the birth of education and training from a distance. In this study, the predictive power of academic staff’s digital competence to gauge their distance education perception was investigated. Secondly, the predictive power of students’ digital literacy to understand their online learning readiness was examined. Method: This study was conducted with a survey design, one of the quantitative research designs. The distance teaching dimension of this study was performed with 201 (F: 119; M: 82) academicians, and the distance learning dimension was carried out with 1612 (F: 1026; M: 580; Other: 6) students. For distance teaching, the predictive power of educators’ digital competence was examined, and the predictive power of students’ digital literacy was examined for the distance learning dimension of this study. Results: For the distance teaching part of this study, results showed a positive and significant relationship between the academic staff’s digital competence and their perceptions of distance education. Furthermore, their digital competence significantly predicted their perceptions. For the distance learning part of this study, the results showed a positive, significant relationship between students' digital literacy and their online learning readiness, and their digital literacy significantly predicted the level of their online learning readiness. The results indicated that the digital skills of both the academic staff and students were a prerequisite for the effectiveness of distance learning and teaching. Implications for Research and Practice: As the results of this research indicate, digital skills have a significant impact on academicians’ perceptions of distance education and on students' readiness for learning. In this regard, supporting the digital skills of both parties will increase their readiness for distance education and, ultimately, students will be able to benefit more from distance education. © 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {The incorporation of technologies in scenarios of social interaction has led to changes in the way in which people communicate, learn and share information. In education, access and massification of digital infrastructure has led to the need to conceptualize and reconceptualize the term digital literacy from various angles as a way of understanding what are the skills needed to participate in a hyperconnected world. In this work, a systematic review of the bibliography related to the topic was carried out using the Scopus database. A diachronic study was carried out that examined 138 articles obtained from the terms digital literacy, education and school. An early conceptualization based on the need to incorporate skills to use technologies instrumentally was identified, and a contemporary reconceptualization in which the idea that mastering hardware and software is enough to consider a person digitally literate is overcome. It is concluded that, in order to make digital literacy conceptualizations, terms such as information literacy, computer literacy and media literacy must necessarily be considered, since new literacies based on the incorporation of technologies in education are articulated on these parameters. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

Currently, there are many theoretical frameworks and ways to measure skills and knowledge related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). This article is an attempt to show the real and declared level of digital skills among future teaching staff. The research was conducted in Poland among 128 students of pedagogical faculties (first-year undergraduate studies). The research used a triangulation of research methods and techniques: diagnostic survey and competency tests related to the use of word processors and spreadsheets, and the level of knowledge about the use of ICT. Competency tests were in accordance with the European Computer Skills Certificate (ECDL) standard. The collected data showed the following: (1) more than half of the students rate their own skills in the use of word processors and spreadsheets, and their overall theoretical knowledge as high or very high; (2) in the case of the real assessment of digital competence, only less than 20% reached the passing threshold in the areas of word processors and theoretical knowledge, with only 1.6% passing in the area of spreadsheets; (3) the declared and actual levels of digital competence were moderately related in the surveyed group; (4) attitudes towards new media, self-assessment of digital skills, and previous learning experience in handling ICT are not predictive factors for ECDL test results. © 2021 by the author.

The emerging direction of talent cultivation is intended to achieve global competence in computational thinking and digital literacy; however, there is still a gap in Taiwan. Scholars and educators have identified the contents of digital literacy, which include statistical concepts, data analysis skills, and critical thinking. To fill this gap, this study proposed an innovative educational teaching method that integrates data visualization techniques and critical thinking training to improve students’ decision-making literacy. An experiment on the curriculum with a one-group pre-test and post-test design was conducted for 79 participants. The data consisted of a geographical data map, visualized data diagrams, and a statistical test; the scores for critical thinking, academic self-confidence, and academic performance were separated into high, middle, and low achievement groups. For data analysis, the bootstrapping method (resampled 1000 times), paired sample t-test, and ANCOVA were applied for data analysis to compare the difference between each independent group. The results showed that the post-test scores (statistic test M = 9.59, infographic test M = 6.09, map test M = 5.02) were higher than the pre-test scores (statistic test M = 7.15, infographic test M = 3.46, map test M = 3.13). The most significant implication is the innovative teaching approach based on integrated data visualization and critical thinking. It plays a very significant role in enhancing decision-making abilities. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Although scholars have highlighted the importance of students' digital informal learning in developing their digital competence, the mediating role of digital informal learning between digital competence and academic performance have remained unexplored. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the mediating role of digital informal learning between higher education students' digital competence and their academic performance. The data were collected from 319 students from Shiraz University in Iran. Data were analysed using structural equation modeling via AMOS. The result showed a positive effect of the students' digital competence on their digital informal learning and academic performance. Moreover, digital informal learning as the mediator variable had a positive effect on the relationship between digital competence and students' academic performance. In conclusion, to improve students’ academic performance, educators and curriculum designers should consider both their digital competence and their digital informal learning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The digitalisation of higher education institutions (HEI), due to the impossibility of face-to-face classes and tutoring, caused by COVID-19, evidenced the need to rethink opportunities and obstacles for the development of digital skills among students. Based on the digital literacy framework by Martin and Grudziecki (2006), a study was developed aiming to identify university students' digital competences, as well as the uses and effects of digital literacy in the development of personal and social skills. Data collection, using an online questionnaire, took place during the initial closing period of HEIs in Portugal. The results point to an almost widespread mastery of search and data editing skills and to a lesser ability to create and develop new digital solutions. Most students reported that digital technologies were used (before the crisis)] mainly for institutional communication and between peers, but not for the development of networking and lifelong learning skills. The lack of involvement of many teachers in the available pedagogical support is an obstacle to an adequate digital transformation in higher education, both in times of crisis and in the future. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

This study, which is part of the European Project Lovedistance - Learning Optmization and Academic Inclusion Via Equitative Distance Teaching and Learning 609949-EPP-1-2019-1-PTEPPKA2-CBHE-JP, aims to measure the levels and dimensions of the competences determined by UNESCO (2016) regarding the teaching action against the use of ICT in educational scenarios. It highlights the possibilities of carrying out ICT-based planning; the design or capacity to organize and build learning scenarios with ICT; and the evaluation or possibility of measuring the effectiveness of ICT for lifelong education, in the educational spaces that are developed as teachers (Coll, 2008). The present study is based on the survey design and uses the questionnaire as an instrument, applying a methodological complementarity with results that indicate through a descriptive analysis that teacher training, teacher coordination and cooperation, and the deepening of the use of technologies, are factors of great importance and favor the use of ICT in the educational community. © 2021 UNIVERSIDADE FEEVALEÂ.

In order to evaluate the current situation and trends, this research study initially presents a review of history, existing trends and digital competence frameworks, learning and teaching methodologies for digital literacy and provides insights and recommendations. The review of existing framework and methods used to assess digital skills of different groups has revealed that self-assessment is an assessment category that most often results in an overestimation of own digital skills by respondents. To address such deficiencies, a digital competency model (DigComp) was created in 2013, as part of the EU Education and Training Agenda 2020. This model describes which skills and competencies are needed to use digital technologies in a confident, critical, collaborative and creative way and to accomplish the goals related to work, learning, and leisure in a digital society. Starting from the existing framework, this research study devises a conceptual model to support teaching and training. Each user group requires a different approach in order to accurately evaluate their digital competences; therefore, the use of a flexible and integrated approach is necessary. The model proposed in this study describes which skills should be learned, how they should be taught, and how they can be assessed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Recent civilizational transformations have led us to search for and introduce new didactic solutions. One of these is e-learning, which is a response to the needs of the education system and its individual stakeholders. The e-learning systems currently available offer similar solutions. Only during direct interaction with a given tool can one notice significant differences in their functionality. By carrying out evaluation studies the indicators that determine this functionality can be identified. The paper presents e-learning in the context of the academic training of the future generations of teachers. The reflections revolve around digital literacy and experience in using modern information and communication technologies in education. The goal of the research was to evaluate three areas: the functionality of the SELI platform, individual experiences with e-learning, and digital literacy. The technique used was an e-learning survey appended to the end of two e-learning courses offered on the platform. The survey was addressed to teachers and students of the biggest pedagogical university in Poland. The general impression of the content presented on the platform was, in most cases, rated as being very good or good. The platform itself was also evaluated positively. Based on the analyses conducted, two groups of platform users were identified. One third of the users have diverse experiences with e-learning, which corresponds with their digital literacy. The remaining two thirds of the respondents need more training in the areas evaluated. The authors of the paper believe that this type of study should accompany all activities that introduce e-learning at every stage of education. Only then will it be possible to discover where the digital divide lies among the teaching staff and learners. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, studies exploring digital literacy practices in the context of tertiary education are still scarce. Within the qualitative approach, this study investigated digital literacy practices by EFL (English as a Foreign Language) postgraduate students. Moreover, it intensively discusses the kinds of digital tools used by the participants and the purposes of using them. Additionally, the way the participants conceptualized digital literacy was also elaborated. Thirty-four EFL Master students of a public university in Bandung, Indonesia, participated in this study. An online open-ended questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were applied in data collection. Meanwhile, eight dimensions of digital literacy in the Hague and Payton’s frameworks were used as the basis of the thematical analysis of the interview data. Results showed that the participants conceptualized digital literacy as soft skills for managing digital information covering the acts of searching, comprehending, evaluating, creating, and sharing. The prominent result of this study relates to how the participants used digital tools for academic/research and general purposes. Subsequently, this study recommends that tertiary education institutions provide more training on maximizing digital tools for academic writing and broader access to prepaid journal articles. Further exploration of lecturers’ digital literacy practices is highly recommended. © 2021, Syiah Kuala University. All rights reserved.},

The concept is based on the combination of new technologies and teaching methods in order to create new ideas and innovations that can enhance learning for modern learners and, at the same time, respond directly to their learning experiences. Thus, instructors are responsible for organizing the environment and creating learner-friendly learning materials using existing technology, which can lead to a digital university learning society. The contributions of this article are: 1) to synthesize the conceptual framework of the SDL MOOCs model, 2) to develop the SDL MOOCs model, 3) to develop instructional processes with self-directed learning to enhance digital literacy skills (SDL process), and 4) to study the results of developing the SDL MOOCs model. The suitability of the SDL MOOCs model was assessed by 15 experts with extensive experience in the fields of online education design and development, computer science and information and communication technologies for education. The results of this research show that: 1) the SDL MOOCs model consists of 4 main elements (input factors, instructional process, output, and feedback), 2) the SDL process consists of 4 stages (preparation, web-based self-directed learning, post-testing, and certificate approval), and 3) the developmental adequacy of the SDL MOOCs model is at a very high level. © 2021 Kassel University Press GmbH.

	abstract = {Education needs to formulate a curriculum that suits the digital era, especially in terms of digital literacy and cyber wellness. This research was conducted to get an overview of digital literacy curriculum management in kindergarten. A total of 122 kindergartens were purposely selected to take part in a survey of this study. Of the 122 kindergartens, 27 kindergartens have integrated digital literacy education in schools, while 95 kindergartens have no integrated digital literacy education in schools. Then, the 27 kindergartens joined a focus group discussion and the results showed that there were six valid and reliable indicators to evaluate the implementation of digital literacy curriculum management in kindergarten, they are: 1)availability of digital infrastructure; 2) competence of managers and teachers in digital literacy; 3) curriculum objectives related to mastery of basic digital literacy competencies in children; 4) digital literacy implementation in school (children’s learning experiences); 5) digital literacy teaching materials and strategies in schools and 6) parental involvement in curriculum development. In addition, there is a need for a technology integration development module in kindergarten classes that can become a guide for teachers and parents when using digital technology with children. ©2021 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

While the dimensions and depth of the concept remain highly appraised, it remains unclear the extent to which teachers nowadays are closer to developing adequate digital competencies and whether online teaching itself is considered a beneficial practice. The present paper tries to address these issues accordingly, by means of on online quantitative study that was carried out between January 1st 2020-January 28th 2021, on a sample of 1267 Romanian respondents. The questionnaire illustrates the teachers’ experience of online education during the COVID-19 pandemic and the central dimensions of our analysis consisted of: the teachers’ perceived progress on digital skills; and trust in their digital competencies; the level of trust offered by the courses for taking online lessons; the perceived use of digital skills from the perspective of students' learning outcomes; a general evaluation of all educational tools offered by online education; and the extent to which the methods and applications of online education will be integrated in the future. The results point to a positive self-assessment of teachers’ digital skills, as well as an important willingness to implement the online education tools back to the everyday classrooms. © 2021, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

Courses and program objectives described in accreditation self-study documents were mapped to a push-versus-pull construct to determine whether teaching technology is pushed into traditional courses or pulled into new courses focused on skill development. Using a matrix of digital journalism skills all courses (N = 121) were analyzed for the existence of technological skills that are currently in use across the profession. Findings show 63% of courses pulled tech skills into technology-specific courses. Of the most intense skill-building courses, 71% (N = 30) were coded as pull or moderate pull. The programs that had the highest digital focus in their self-study documents both pushed and pulled across the curricula, while in the low-innovation groups courses clustered into moderately pushing and pulling technology skills. The results indicate that curricular changes should make room for focused digital skills classes that pair with application opportunities throughout the program. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background: “Digital Partners” is an intergenerational information and communications technology learning project carried out in the municipalities of Vic and Centelles (Catalonia) from April to May 2018. Within the framework of the introduction of community service as a subject in secondary education, the Centre for Health and Social Studies (University of Vic) created a training space with 38 intergenerational partners (aged 14-15 years and >65 years), with the aim of improving the senior users' digital skills in terms of use of smartphones and tablets, thus helping reduce the digital divide in the territory. Objective: The aim of this paper is to evaluate the satisfaction of both junior and senior participants toward the intervention and to explore its main drivers. Methods: Participants who volunteered to participate in the study were interviewed. Quantitative and qualitative data gathered in paper-based ad hoc surveys were used to assess participants' satisfaction. Results: The experience shows a broad satisfaction of both junior and senior users. The project's strengths include the format of working in couples; randomly pairing individuals by operating system; the ability to practice with the device itself; individuals' free choice to decide what they wish to learn, develop, or practice; and the availability of voluntary practice material that facilitates communication and learning. With regard to aspects that could be improved, there is a need to review the timetabling flexibility of meetings to avoid hurrying the elderly and to extend the project's duration, if necessary. Conclusions: This activity can serve to create mutual learning through the use of mobile devices and generate security and motivation on the part of the seniors, thus reducing the digital divide and improving social inclusion. © Francesc López Seguí, Marc de San Pedro, Eva Aumatell Verges, Salvador Simó Algado, Francesc Garcia Cuyàs.

This article examines an undergraduate course called Community Organizations in a Digital World that responds to the new demands for innovations in nonprofit organizations. We present the overall course design, including assignments, and the findings of a pretest and a posttest of individual student digital literacy and student reflections on their digital literacy. Based on the two-stage survey, students’ digital literacy significantly improved when they completed the course. Moreover, students appreciated the importance and the difficulty of using social media in their future career. They also recognized the effect of algorithms and social justice issues of accessing technology.

Based on a systematic analysis of qualitative data obtained from an entrepreneurship digital program with women from marginalized communities in Northeast Mexico (Monterrey), we examine the transformative potential of education. This is done with the use of a participatory action research paradigm and a decolonial perspective with the use of participant observation, semi-structured interviews and ethnographic tools. This study systematizes the experiences of a group of women who transformed their living conditions with the technological intervention and meaningful learning experiences, highlighting their life stories and success cases. This research evidences that future and digital literacies are key components to developing transformative learning experiences that have an impact on a community's social and economic improvement to think about different and possible lifestyles. Results also show the personal and learning profile of each participant and its relationship with the development of a specific scenario on the intersection of the skills in the areas of future and digital literacies. Discussions are built toward the possibilities of improving people’s present conditions when enhancing their future and digital skills.

However, this idea is often seen in instrumental terms, and is rarely implemented in any coherent or comprehensive way. This paper suggests that we need to move beyond a binary view of digital media as offering risks and opportunities for young people, and the narrow ideas of digital skills and internet safety to which it gives rise. The article propose that we should take a broader and more critical approach to the rise of 'digital capitalism', and to the ubiquity of digital media in everyday life. In this sense, the paper argue that the well-established conceptual framework and pedagogical strategies of media education can and should be extended to meet the new challenges posed by digital and social media. This article presents some reflections as an epigraph of the special issue "Digital learning: distraction or default for the future", whose final result has allowed us to group a set of critical research and analysis on the inclusion of digital technologies in educational contexts.

Given the lack of evidence, this article draws on semi-structured interviews with experts in the United Kingdom, enhanced by a diary methodology and a conversational approach to the think aloud method, to explore how they engage with and evaluate online content. In doing so, it addresses what digital literacy entails and how to promote it across the national curriculum for England. It is argued that the ability to evaluate online content involves not only reflections on the nature and origin of information, contextual knowledge and the use of multiple sources, but also functional and critical digital skills and knowledge about the internet and the digital environment. Relatedly, it is argued that the Citizenship and Computing curricula should be revised to promote digital literacy as a cross-curricular subject. © 2020 The Author},

There are some international studies, such as PISA (Program International Student Assessment) and ICILS (International Computer and Information Literacy Study), which allow to evaluate some associative relationship and to make a conclusion about using digital technologies in the learning environment. In 2018 Ukraine participated in PISA for the first time in the Paper-Based Assessment (PBA) format and didn’t participate in ICILS. Now we don't have any national or international studies, which will be able to answer a question about readiness Ukrainian students to Computer-Based Assessment (CBA), only we have some results from PISA 2018. This research presents analyze the PISA 2018 Database and some other results of studies. We studied how digital technologies influence on the student's achievement of main literacy domains. So, in other words, we wanted to evaluate how the digital environment impacts students' readiness for effective implementation in a changing digital world. The results of Ukraine and other countries are useful for the formation of key policies for Ukraine concerning the development of the digital competencies of Ukrainian students.

What's more for students, digital technology makes it easy to access, share, analyze, and present information obtained from various digital sources. The research aims to develop indicators and assess students' digital literacy competencies. Methods: This research is a descriptive quantitative study. The population taken was students of non-formal education at the State University of Padang. The sample was taken 117 respondents using a purposive sampling technique. The data was collected by distributing questionnaires. Measurement of the level of digital literacy based on the Likert scale (1-5), the results are interpreted as never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always. Results: Of the 117 students, 45.01% of students often use and choose digital media in learning and digital media can complete assignments. 37.61% of students had never checked a trustworthy website and on a different website. 30.39% of students never post the latest information they get. 38.46% of students never communicate via the internet with colleagues from other disciplines and professional experts to complete assignments. 43.02% of students never used the internet to search for ideas through the internet to improve products and find new techniques in completing assignments. Conclusion: This study reflects the initial ability and willingness of non-formal education students to develop digital literacy competencies which in turn provide opportunities for education and policymakers to develop curricula and learning based on information and communication technology. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {An efficient organization of the educational process within rapid acceleration of the society digitization is impossible without increasing its digital literacy, if the latter is really estimated and new models of digital learning didactics are developed respectively. So, it is necessary to study an actual state of digital literacy, as well as to search for and introduce new learning models in the educational system based on the use of modern innovative technologies and digital learning methods. The objective of the research is to examine the level of the digital literacy of teachers, and also opportunities and promising trends within the digital didactics for the formation of competencies as the basis of a new model for the development of a new learning model in the context of the formation of the digital knowledge society. Two main methods have been used - elaboration of the abstract and logical model and a survey. In the research the data obtained as a result of the survey conducted in 2018 by NAFI Analytical Centre related to the measurement of the digital literacy level of teachers and lecturers in Russia were used. The number of respondents made up 634 lecturers (higher education) as well as 555 teachers (general education). The digital literacy formation model was developed based on the didactic learning triangle taking into account the synthesis of three learning environments - real, virtual and neurocognitive. The analysis of the survey data demonstrated that in the aggregate of the compared indices for different social groups of the population, school teachers and lecturers of higher educational institutions have reached the higher level of the digital literacy, which significantly exceeds the average Russian level. So, in Russia as a whole the index of the digital literacy of the adult population by a similar measurement method makes up 52% out of 100% possible ones, school teachers - 87%, lecturers of higher educational institutions - 88%. The use of research results in practice is possible with the improvement of training programs, the exchange of international experience and further researches. © Kassel University Press GmbH.},

	abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies are connected to student achievement and learning outcomes. However, students may get few opportunities to learn, practice, and apply these strategies in traditional classrooms. We examine the associations between SRL strategies and performance in a digital literacy platform, Actively Learn, for K-12 education. This platform gives students opportunities to engage in SRL and collects trace data on their use of the system. We examined four SRL-related features from 14,575 students’ activity data. We applied hierarchical linear models using assignment scores as the outcome variable. We found that all SRL strategies had positive associations with science scores, and that these associations were stronger for short-answer scores than for multiple choice question scores. Our results support the construct validity of log measures of SRL and offer insights into how the benefits of SRL may vest differently depending on assessment type. © ISLS.},

	abstract = {Technology is part of our life and it cannot be separated from our daily life. Consciously or not this will affect the behavior of each individual. Rapid progress in technology makes the children of the current generation increasingly grow into smarter and more critical generation. Fortunately, most parents often use this sophisticated technology as a means to make the children stay busy or as a means for negotiating with them. So, it is necessary to apply an appropriate method. STEAM which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics is a very important method in child development. This method emphasizes on active learning, and it stimulates children to solve problems. Through STEAM children are trained to focus on solutions, to build logical and systematic ways of thinking and to improve their critical thinking. All of them are intended to prepare the children to build their sense of competitiveness and to prepare them for career opportunities in the technical and creative fields in the future. Family as one of the smallest units in society can be the main agent in reviving digital literacy. Therefore, family also plays an important role for the success of the program. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It focuses on Twitter as the media of digital literacy they actively employ. Responses to tweets are assessed with Anderson’s taxonomic indicators (namely remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating) in order to know the cognitive level of society under the framework of social education. With regards to the notion of the Indonesian women Muslim activists, this article refers to four daughters of the late Abdurrahman Wahid, Alissa Qotrunnada, Zannuba Ariffah Chafsoh, Anita Hayatunnufus, and Inayah Wulandari, being known as social activists on religions, multiculturalism, equality, democracy, and human rights, particularly through their tweets. This paper argues that women Muslim activists play a key role in making use of digital media for leading the Indonesian Muslim community to become a critical society. Through the enhancement of the society’s cognitive level, it further argues, those women Muslim activists have skillfully developed digital literacy-based social education for people’s socio-political criticism. © 2020, State Islamic University of Sunan Ampel.

Digital disruption in the education sector is unavoidable. The results of this study will be useful for educators and students to establish guidelines on how to utilize SRLS to enhance digital literacy competence and hence lifelong learning as developing human capital for the future workplace is crucial. Since research supports the fact that digital natives lack digital literacy, this paper look at how SRLS can foster digital literacy because it assists students to manage their learning independently online. Furthermore, there is a dearth of evidence on the effects of SRLS on digital literacy. How SRLS can elevate digital literacy is still rudimentary. To fulfill the purpose of the study, four hypotheses were formulated. A cross sectional survey of full-time undergraduates from IT or Multimedia programs to examine the relationships between the use of self-regulated learning strategies towards digital literacy in digital learning within from selected private universities with blended learning environments in the central region of Malaysia.A total of 563 respondents were analyzed via Structured Equation Modelling using Partial least Squares (PLS) to obtain the final results. The results of the hypotheses revealed three out of four hypotheses were supported corroborating that three domains of SRLS (metacognitive knowledge, resource management, and motivational beliefs) showed a significant positive influence on digital literacy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The objective of this study was to measure student self-perception about their own 21st century digital skills related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in Higher Education. A questionnaire was generated and applied to 356 students with the stratified random sampling technique. A principal component analysis was carried out, supported by adequate values of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient and the Bartlett sphericity test. The data indicate that students primarily use digital technology in academic projects and are quite skillful when using ICT for information management, to develop critical thinking and to solve problems, as well as to manage mobile devices. However, their self-perception in the use of ICT in teaching classes is low. The results suggest that the students do not believe that the use of ICT in the classroom is useful for developing this type of emerging digital skills. On the other hand, they think that carrying out academic projects does strengthen the acquisition and development of such skills in relation to the use of ICT. © 2019 Grupo Comunicar Ediciones.},

Within the project one issue is the empowerment of people with disabilities’ participation through low-threshold learning and demonstrating experience laboratories like MakerSpaces. To do so, EL4 installed a so called “Mini-FabLab” in a sheltered workshop in Bottrop. This Mini-FabLab looks at digital technologies from a social and not just from a technological perspective – it thus does not ask for general technological designs, but rather asks for new social practices like the empowerment of people with disabilities. Furthermore with its location in an old covered storage room, the Mini-FabLab illustrates that every place can become a place for inclusion. Through this, the Mini-FabLab enables people with disabilities the opportunity to develop individualized 3D-printed objects and assistance systems for their workplace as well as for their everyday life. As a result, various objects, like for example twist locks, keychains, toothpaste squeeze and blade stoppers were developed to use it as toys but also as assistive tools. Some of these will be presented in the paper, whereby the process of the idea finding (identification of a problem), development and solution of the object will be described in detail. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {With the digitalisation of education increasing, the relationship between student engagement in Technology-enhanced Learning (TEL) and digital skills has remained largely unexplored. There is a strong consensus that engagement is necessary for students to succeed in school. We hypothesised that students reporting high and low levels of general engagement display differences in terms of their engagement in TEL, and that students’ digital skills correlate with their engagement in and disengagement in TEL, which in turn is related to their learning outcomes. We used statistical tests to explore the relationship between the students’ (N = 410) general engagement and engagement in TEL, and investigated how digital skills were related to engagement and disengagement in TEL. We found significant correlations between students’ digital skills and engagement in TEL, showing that the possession of high levels of digital skill is related to engagement in TEL. Interestingly, digital skills were not related to disengagement. This suggests that students reporting both high and low levels of digital skills disengage to some extent when learning with technologies. We also identified variables reflecting both engagement and disengagement in TEL that predict student performance as measured via final grades, implying that in order to understand and support students who learn with technologies, a broader understanding of the factors influencing engagement and disengagement is key. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the generation of those born in a digital environment, devices are understood as something natural in the way of obtaining instant information. The educational system has adapted and developed new pedagogical models, to combine teaching with the intrinsic characteristics of digital students. In this scenario, meaningful learning provides the educational system with an active model that allows the student to associate the new information with the one they already have, readjusting and rebuilding both in the process. In this context, new technologies act as mediating tools for learning, favoring pedagogical practices in teacher-student relationships. The application of Information and Communication Technologies promote the acquisition of abilities, skills and knowledge for its subsequent professional and social application. Thus, the objective of the study was to identify the scientific publications related to significant learning and the technologies applied in higher education during the period 2000 to 2019. A bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature was carried out. For this, 1,161 documents on this topic were identified. The results of the analysis revealed that scientific productivity has increased since 2010, verifying the deep interest in new technological resources applied to teaching.

	abstract = {The wide expansion of digital technologies in higher education has introduced the need for an examination of the added value of various technological tools for quality teaching and active individual and collaborative learning. The current study explored whether and how the pedagogical design of an academic course, which developed a variety of digital literacy competencies, supported students in regulating collaborative technology-enhanced learning and helped them cope with the sense of psychological ownership over collaborative learning outcomes. In addition, we examined how these issues were expressed in cognitive, emotional and social aspects of students' perceived learning (Caspi & Blau, 2011). During four semesters, we conducted a qualitative analysis on reflective learning diaries, written by 78 graduate students studying education (N = 1870 codes). The bottom-up analysis focused on learning processes that enabled the development of various digital literacies conceptualized by the Digital Literacy Framework (DLF; Eshet-Alkalai, 2012): photo-visual, information, reproduction, branching, social-emotional, and real-time thinking skills. Furthermore, findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation and learning new technologies as an integral part of digital literacies. In addition, social-emotional statements expressed the development of effective communication and collaboration that enable students to cope with a sense of ownership over learning outcomes, and present different levels of teamwork: sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. Qualitative coding provided a more granulated perspective on perceived learning by differentiating between positive and negative aspects of emotional and social retrospection during the learning process. The findings contribute to educational theory by extending DLF and by providing new insights to the literature on students' perceived learning. We discuss the implications for instructional design and adoption of innovative pedagogy in higher education. © 2019},

	abstract = {Self-Directed Learning (SDL) is a process in which adult learners initiate their inner motivation to learn by themselves to increase their knowledge, skills and experiences from resources and evaluating learning outcomes. Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and resources of an organization. Learners use KM to gain their knowledge. To access to these resources, the learners must know Digital Literacy Abilities (DLA). We developed a model for SDL with KM to enhance DLA: The model was synthesized from related works and verified by five experts in various fields. Data instrument was derived from focus group discussion including a five-level Likert scale of the appropriateness of the model, and experts’ opinions and recommendations. Then, collected data were analyzed with content analysis; mean (x̄), standard deviation (S.D.). After discussion, the model was adjusted according to the experts’ recommendations. It contained three circles from inner to outer: SDL, KM, and DLA, respectively. SDL had four steps: readiness triggers, setting goal and planning, learning activities, and learning’s evaluation. KM contained five steps: knowledge discovery, knowledge capture and storage, knowledge application and distribution, knowledge evaluation, and knowledge creation. DLA had four aspects: operation literacy, analysis and evaluation literacy, value and creation literacy, and social-culture-organization cooperation literacy. Overall, the results of analyzed data from the experts towards on appropriateness of the model were at high level (x̄ = 4.4, S.D. = 0.6). This model will be continued to implement for adult learners’ activities. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

After reviewing key tenets of recent debates, I advance a specific under-standing of the concept – critical digital literacy – that, as I argue, comprehensively addresses issues of knowledge, competencies, and skills in relation to digital technologies. In particular, I posit that critical thinking about educational and other values of ‘the digital’ needs to take structural aspects of the technology into account that are often eschewed in instrumental or commercially-driven approaches. To prepare pupils for their future lives requires a widest pos-sible contextualisation of technology, including issues of exploitation, commodification, and degradation in digital capitalism. Finally, I make concrete suggestions for constructive uses of technology in teaching and learning. © 2019, Unified Theory of Information Research Group. All rights reserved.},

Although there is consensus about the necessary 21st century competences, there is a need to operationalize and examine how students may reach these competences. This design-based research study investigated how the design of digital games for learning could support students in developing specific digital literacy competences. Based on the hypothesis that students can become digitally competent by developing educational games, this project examined a new curriculum for digital literacy proposed by the Ministry of Education in Denmark. In the present project, K7-K9 students used a game-based learning design to create educational VR games using the CoSpaces Edu (2020) tool, which is an interactive 3D application. The students were guided through iterative design phases and discussions as they created educational games for their peers with the help of two game-based learning design frameworks. Next, an analysis was conducted on the elements in the students' digital game design processes that contributed to them reaching specific learning goals of the new digital literacy curriculum. The findings of the analysis indicated that by going through the various design and development phases of creating digital games for learning, the students were able to develop 14 out of the 17 learning goals of the new digital literacy curriculum. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

The chapter briefly explores assumptions around “digital natives, " as they (mis) inform digital technology applications and instruction in higher education. It discusses socialization and enactments of gender as they impact educational choices and credentialing within higher education. The chapter highlights how this socialization leads to significant differences in technological efficacy and usage by gender that challenge sweeping claims of increasing societal democratization. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

Older adults, not due to their frailty or age, often find it difficult to use digital devices like smartphones, and they often lack the basic digital literacy required to use multimedia interactive devices with touchscreen technology. This is the major reason why they are experiencing the sharp digital divide in the twenty-first century. In this study, older adults from four European countries participated in a two-phase process: playing interactive games on a large touchscreen tablet and learning how to use a smartphone to access digital services. The attitudes and the difficulties associated with adopting the skills to operate the device and use the digital services were observed and discussed. The findings and recommendations for an effective approach to this problem are discussed at the end of the paper. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The purpose of this study is to identify the influence of the level of education parents have on the digital expertise of students in supporting learning in urban sprawl impacted areas, this is intended to recommend handling the problem of low levels of knowledge of students about the use of technology to support learning and so that students have good digital expertise to support his work in the future. Data analysis used is descriptive qualitative to explore social factors of the community and students who develop in Colomadu District. Data were obtained through interview methods accompanied by questionnaires in the study area. The results of this study illustrate that the low level of education of parents will lead to low income and socio-economic conditions, thus becoming a barrier to information and digital abilities of students in urban sprawl affected areas. Students tend to have digital expertise when the level of education of parents is in a good level and has a good economic level, besides that it is found that regional development does not necessarily have a positive impact on increasing students' knowledge about technology. Furthermore, the low level of digital ability of students will be predicted to become an obstacle in the future. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {It can be argued that multimodal digital literacy practices promote the development of literacy skills needed for today's world without being constrained to one mode of learning. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the employment of multimodal practices during instruction within EFL classrooms in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is minimal and fraught with obstacles to its effective utilization. It is, therefore, important to determine whether this is the case and, if so, to develop strategies that would ameliorate this situation. This study, therefore, sought to identify KSA postsecondary EFL instructors’ self-reporting of their use of various types of technology, computer software, and online software; the different teaching/learning and assessment strategies that they employ; the obstacles they face with the use of technology in their classrooms; and their beliefs about the use of multimodal digital literacy practices for teaching and learning. The study, which was based on the premises of social semiotic theory, utilized a mixed-methods design from which survey and focus group interview data were triangulated. The findings demonstrated that while most postsecondary EFL instructors have a strong positive attitude towards multimodal digital literacy practices and make robust use of specific types of technology and software programs, obstacles prevent these practices from being more widely and frequently deployed in the KSA. Suggestions for how to make a transformation to a more pronounced use of multimodal practices happen and the limitations to the study are also presented. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Digital literacy has become a widely studied topic for connecting people, participation in government and public affairs. It encourages library professionals to train students and effectively acquire, preserve and disseminate knowledge. Academic libraries involve using digital technology improved the students’ level of digital literacy and technological skills. This paper aims to understand the students’ technological competence in using database resources and searching for online information. In addition, to evaluate the training contents and designated instructors on digital literacy education, the study also focuses on digitally exposed students’ learning behavior, the library management and students’ academic interaction on new technological trends. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative method for which primary data were collected from university students using a structured research questionnaire. Through targeted random sampling techniques, 1,500 printed questionnaires were distributed among students, and 1,266 (84.4%) responses were received. The authors applied descriptive statistics to analyze the demographic information of male and female students. The statistical technique Chi-square test (χ2) was applied using SPSS to determine the association between variables. Moreover, Bonferroni correction for the new a value [modified = 0.05/number of possible comparisons/analysis for each question shown in Tables (II-IX)] was also used to avoid a family-wise error. Findings: The results inferred a strong association between students’ technological skill with using digital tools, utilization of database resources and browsing networked information on the Web. The association between universities in terms of recruiting designated instructors on digital literacy education, introducing ICT based curriculum and the association between library management in maintaining a regular training program on digital literacy demonstrated a negative association. Besides, the findings disclosed that student’s digital exposure is not the forcing factor in developing technological competence, but found to be a more encouraging factor. It was also concluded that library technological involvement significantly improves student technology-based learning skills. Practical implications: The results obtained after the analyzed data may help library management in providing long-term strategy for improving digital literacy education and training for students in the effective utilization of technology for better academic performance and social integration. Originality/value: The study was based on quantitative methods using a questionnaire. Extensive database coverage and digital literacy skills based on coach input can improve student performance and academic quality. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {It has been widely acknowledged that learners of English as an additional or second language need to develop rich repertoires of digital literacies to be able to read, write, and communicate in digital spaces in English. However, finding appropriate approaches is challenging for many practitioners, and teaching digital literacies often focuses on basic technical skills rather than catering for a wider range of students’ technological, language, sociocultural, pragmatic, and critical literacy needs. This article explains digital literacies from a sociocultural perspective, offered by Literacy Studies; describes how this theory promotes a situated problem-based learning approach to classroom practices; and provides a brief overview of the pedagogical model—the 3D model of literacy (Green, 2002). To illustrate theory in action, the article offers three examples of learning units: designing a webpage, information search, and creating and maintaining a digital presence that can be adapted by teachers or used as a model for developing resources. By designing these theoretically informed examples, the article makes a contribution to practice in the field of language education, which currently lacks explicit practical guidelines. This article can be useful to teachers at different career stages developing or refining their pedagogies for digital literacies in second language contexts. © 2019 TESOL International Association},

This course was designed by using blended learning strategies as well as BYOD (bring your own device) technology. We emphasize that the inclusion of such course in the curriculum fosters the development of digital literacy skills of first-year students and create the preconditions for the formation of an effective personal learning environment. The research question was to evaluate the level of digital literacy of freshman students and analyze the Digital Literacy Course impact on students' preparedness to use the ICT during the learning process. Such course was implemented for the students of different specialties. It gave a possibility to analyze the differences between engineering students and representatives of other specialties. The survey was carried out which includes the question related to tools, which students use during the lessons. The purposes of different tools using including teamwork and problem solving have been analyzed. As a result, the improvement of Digital Literacy skills of first-year engineering students was observed. © 2020 SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings.

An online survey was designed to gather data from 1595 students, which reduced to 867 after data cleaning. The objective of this research study is to evaluate the digital literacy status of freshmen at a higher education institute and evaluate if there is any correlation between their literacies and their overall digital literacy. The digital literacy competencies of the freshmen were evaluated by using a newly designed Digital Literacy Scale (DLS). For each student, the literacy score for each component of digital literacy identified for this study (media, information, technology, computer, visual, and communication literacy) and the overall digital literacy was calculated using the DLS. The results show that the freshmen were highly digitally literate. The Cronbach alpha test showed that the newly designed DLS was reliable and had a high internal consistency. A correlation analysis - Spearman's correlation was also carried out which indicated that the overall digital literacy of the students was dependent on the individual score for each of the component of the digital literacy identified in this study. © Proceedings of the 24th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Information Systems (IS) for the Future, PACIS 2020.

	abstract = {There has been a long tradition of demonstrating formal education’s direct relationship with many dimensions of development, including increased productivity, health, reduced mortality, population control etc. There has also been a literature looking particularly at the ‘democratic dividend’ from education, both through the lens of global citizenship as well as more generally through education’s influence on political participation. The successful securing of global citizenship education (GCE) within the ambitions of Sustainable Development Goal 4.7 in September 2015 was a further milestone in connecting social development with ‘democracy, good governance and the rule of law’. Accordingly, there are many telling examples of how GCE can be rolled out in school curricula, through many different school subjects, across the world. Arguably, however, the formal school system is far from being the only location where messages about citizenship, whether global, national or local, can be found. During the period, 2016–2019 in the USA and UK, with the huge rise in smart-phone usage world-wide, it has become apparent that there can be massive micro-targeting, through global platforms, of selected populations with multiple messages about citizenship, national identity, job security, migration threats, potential terrorism and a great deal else. Unlike the citizenship curricula and textbooks of formal schools which are easily accessible, a great deal of this new social media messaging is relatively inaccessible, using procedures that are a long way from traditional electioneering. They are also much less financially accountable, but it is clear that vast sums are now being spent on social media advertising, presenting an existential threat to democracy. The role and level of education in reacting critically to social media campaigning will need to be revisited in this new world of campaigning around global and national citizenship. It is no longer a discussion about education’s positive relationship with increased political participation, but whether current education levels are actually capable of dealing with the current threats to citizenship, at global, national and local levels. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Although there is consensus about the necessary 21st century competences, there is a need to operationalize and examine how students may reach these competences. This design-based research study investigated how the design of digital games for learning could support students in developing specific digital literacy competences. Based on the hypothesis that students can become digitally competent by developing educational games, this project examined a new curriculum for digital literacy proposed by the Ministry of Education in Denmark. In the present project, K7-K9 students used a game-based learning design to create educational VR games using the CoSpaces Edu (2020) tool, which is an interactive 3D application. The students were guided through iterative design phases and discussions as they created educational games for their peers with the help of two game-based learning design frameworks. Next, an analysis was conducted on the elements in the students' digital game design processes that contributed to them reaching specific learning goals of the new digital literacy curriculum. The findings of the analysis indicated that by going through the various design and development phases of creating digital games for learning, the students were able to develop 14 out of the 17 learning goals of the new digital literacy curriculum. © ECGBL 2020.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {New media has brought constant evolution to professional journalism practices and news genres. Online news practices challenge the occupational jurisdiction of journalism with a multiplicity of conflicting and competing journalistic ideals. In order to prepare journalism students to meet the demands of online journalism today, journalism schools have developed courses that emphasize journalistic practice on online news platforms and tools, such as Twitter, WordPress.com, Soundslides Plus, etc. Drawing on the theoretical lens of digital literacies, Multimedia News Storytelling as Digital Literacies problematizes the emphasis on transmission of certain professional values and news formats without raising students' critical awareness that there can be diversity of values. Methodologically, the present study proposes a genre-aware, semiotic-aware, critical framework that aims at analyzing digital literacies required and practiced by online journalists. It simultaneously encompasses dimensions of professional culture, professional practices, and abstraction of instantiated meaning making via multimodal semiotic resources. Multimedia News Storytelling as Digital Literacies is ideal for courses in journalism and mass communication, curriculum studies, and digital literacies. The book is a valuable resource for online journalism educators, journalism students, and online journalism practitioners. © 2019 Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., New York. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The inclusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in people's daily lives, as well as their influence on the development of multiple professional and personal spheres, has taken on a notorious role for society when it comes to being communicated and informed. This is leading to the creation of numerous jobs that, until a few years ago, did not exist. Because of this, education must respond to the needs and realities that exist today and offer students a quality education. In this way, current education professionals must be trained and updated in order to meet and attend to the needs of students in the new media and digital environment. The objective of this study is to know the degree of digital literacy, as well as the instruments used by English teachers in the Primary Education stage. To this end, research has been carried out using a quantitative methodology with the participation of a total of 112 educators specialising in English from the Community of Madrid, through the creation of a survey. Among the most outstanding results, it can be pointed out that teachers are committed to the use of ICT in their classrooms. However, they present a medium-low training in the subject. In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the level of digital literacy among teaching staff must be as optimal as possible, thus offering a response in accordance with society's demand. © 2020, Universidad Pablo de Olavide.

For the purpose of competence acquisition, six online courses have been created which all revolve around the field of ‘digital linguistics’, including localization in the digital age and post-editing machine translation. We provide an overview of the project, the course contents and the didactic methodology. In addition, we discuss which competencies and skills will be essential for translators who have just graduated and whether, how and to what extent these can be integrated into translator education curricula. Finally, the paper demonstrates how the DigiLing courses can be used to train trainers of translation students so that the former can remain up to date with respect to the job profiles of translators today and going forward. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

But the phenomenon shows that not all people are Able to use information technology and the Internet efficiently, and the information disseminated through the internet is not entirely quality information. Therefore, Internet users need digital literacy skills, that is the ability to use information technology efficiently and the ability to find, Evaluate, use, make information, and use it wisely, and lawfully. The problem is who should be held responsible to digital literacy education for the community. Public libraries can play a role in the digital literacy education for the community. Purpose: This study aims to find out how the management of ICT education in the Regional Public Library (PUSDA) of Sumedang Regency, West Java, as an effort for digital literacy education community. Method: The research method used is a qualitative method with descriptive analysis, and the data collection techniques with observation, interviews, focus group discussions, and literature study. Findings: The result shows the subject taught in ICT with the relevant training on participants' needs. The participants are students and jobless. Most of of participants did not have Reviews their own computer, they were very happy to take part in the ICT training in the library because it was free. Teachers are library staff and outside personnel assistance. Computer used are owned by the library and donations from industry. The way of teaching was easy to understand and the participants could practice using computers and search the internet. The PUSDA staff organized the training with enthusiasm. Conclusion: There are some aspects that are already owned by the public library which will support the implementation of digital literacy education effectively and efficiently. Among them is the library already has computer facilities, has a staff of professionals, and already has access to sources of digital information online. © 2019, Airlangga University Faculty of Vocational Studies.

It represents a curricular reform project of the "Curriculum 4.0" program (Stifterverband). In six modules, the qualification requirements for digital skills are addressed. Evaluation Methodology: The qualitative evaluation of the course concept took place in the form of semi-structured interviews. All 58 participants from five courses were interviewed. Results: Using the "Qualitative Content Analysis" according to Philipp Mayring, the statements were divided into deductive main categories (process, content, methodology, learning success, learning experience and conclusion). The results reflect the student's view of the curriculum and the current qualification needs that still need to be specialised.

	abstract = {As long ago as 1988, Austria introduced the subject “Computer Science” in grade 9. Quite a long time there was solely this one year of mandatory IT-education during school career. In 2011, all European countries had digital education policies in place, either as standalone policies or as part of a national ICT strategy. The strategic weight of these policies remained on nurturing students' digital competences, justified by future economic benefits. For Austria, these changes have not resulted in further computer science education in school. When Austria implemented the new mandatory subject “Digital Education” in September 2018 for all students in lower secondary education, computer science education finally found its way into additional grades. The curriculum covers digital competences, media competences, as well as civic education. Schools can decide if they offer stand-alone subjects or if they implement the curriculum in an integrative way in several other subjects. However, schools still fight the problem who is teaching and how, because most schools just cannot install an extra subject, due to lack of teachers or lack of teaching hours available. This paper reports on the implementation of the subject “Digital Education” in Upper Austrian schools and takes a closer look at first experiences by evaluating a survey answered by 117 teachers approximately two years after the implementation of the new subject.

	abstract = {Introduction: Amidst claims that rapid technological changes in health far outstrip the capabilities of the health workforce, digital literacy is featured in occupational therapy competency standards. However, little attention have been given to the development of digital literacy in entry-level occupational therapy programmes and the preparation of graduates for digital health. There is a lack of guidance on how universities can demonstrate digital literacy development in occupational therapy students. The aim of this study was to test the usefulness of a digital literacy framework and mapping tool in identifying opportunities for students to develop digital literacy within an entry-level occupational therapy programme. Methods: Intrinsic case study design was used to test the usefulness of the digital literacy framework and mapping tool. The framework and tool were applied to the curriculum of a large entry-level Australian occupational therapy programme. Results: Through the process of mapping, key insights were developed on how digital literacy was embedded across the occupational therapy curricula. Limited attention was given to the development of student digital literacy in the early years of the programme. In later years, more opportunities were available to develop digital literacy at basic and intermediate levels. Across the programme, there was limited evidence of the development of advanced digital literacy. Conclusions: The framework and mapping tool were useful in broadening understanding of the concept of digital literacy beyond information communication technologies. The framework and tool can assist those designing or refining occupational therapy curricula to operationalise the notion of digital literacy for practice, and prompt discussion and debate on digital literacy and requirements for students, graduates and occupational therapists in an ever-changing complex health environment. © 2020 Occupational Therapy Australia},

The aim of the study was to assess Latvian teachers' readiness to study online with focus on the differences of respondents' socio-demographic or professional characteristics. 1092 teachers from 100 schools filled in the self-evaluation survey form online. Statistically significant differences were found in all subscales of the survey. Differences in digital skills and in readiness to study online were found at all education levels by respondents' gender, age group or place of living. Younger respondents, males or city inhabitants showed higher rates. E-learning course should be customized, taking into account learners' socio-demographic parameters and online learning readiness rate. © 2019 Evija Mirķe et al., published by Sciendo 2019.},

However, scientists all over the world have identified a common problem all over the globe: There is a strong gap in the world of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). Statistics gathered through numerous research show that women make up a lesser percentage in the workforce, and girls and women are limited in their training to delve into these fields of study. The project described and presented in this manuscript is one of these efforts: The Women in Action project had a specific goal: To help women in vulnerable situations to develop their digital and entrepreneurship skills in Monterrey and Tijuana, Mexico. The workshop was active during the years 2017 to 2019. This document describes the core elements of the program, it's theoretical framework and some of the results gathered from video interviews and field notes taken by the facilitators during its active period, in order to help share the experience and lessons gathered through the extension of this project. The core message that wants to be delivered through this document is the following: If given the opportunity, women from diverse backgrounds demonstrated a fierce thirst for knowledge to hone their digital literacy skills. More efforts to provide these sorts of opportunities in the future will definitely have an impact in the long run if we want to reduce the gap of STEM. © 2020 ACM.},

The transformation of the research paradigm based on big data has put forward higher requirements for the digital literacy of both tutors and graduate students. At present, domestic researches on the improvement path of digital literacy mostly focus on the 'traditional growth point' of specialized literacy courses, ignoring the connection between tutor's digital literacy and graduate students' digital literacy. Based on Bandura's social learning theory, this paper takes the improvement of graduate students' digital literacy as the focus and destination and explores the influence of graduate tutors on graduate students' digital literacy. It is found that the tutor's information behavior has an important influence on the digital literacy of graduate students in the stages of observation, attention, retention and motivation. Facing up to this influence and making it a new growth point is of great significance for tutors and graduate students. In the practice of digital education, we should achieve the organic combination of specialized digital literacy courses and the influence of instructors, so that they work together to enhance the digital literacy of graduate students. © 2019 IEEE.},

Younger generations receive education in digital literacy education during their schooling, while adults are frequently lacking such competences once they leave formal education and find employment. Public libraries aim to bridge the digital divide and provide access to critical information and activities to anyone interested in acquisition of knowledge and skills for use of IT and use of digital information sources. The purpose of the research conducted in form of a survey was to confirm an important role of public libraries as places of informal and continuing education in digital literacy in an environment different from schools and universities (places of formal education). The research results in this paper show that public libraries are active facilitators and educational partners in introducing digital literacy to their users. In spite of some obstacles, public libraries remain determined to provide access to critical information sources and activities, which would lead to greater proficiency in digital literacy. © 2020 Croatian Society MIPRO.},

Digital media are important in the world of education since they help teachers to present materials contextually, visually, interestingly, and interactively. The present study was aimed at identifying student teachers’ perceptions on the use of digital literacy as a learning resource. The study was a survey involving students of the universities that had a partnership with USAID Priority as the research population. A total sample of 168 students were selected from seven universities. Data were collected using questionnaires, interviews, and documentation. The weighting of the questionnaire scores used the Likert’s scale. The variable Digital Literacy consisted of four indicators of ICT basic competencies, informational skills, media awareness, and computational thinking. The findings showed that the student teachers had good perceptions in the use of digital literacy as a learning resource. On the ICT basic skill indicator, the average score was at the high category; on the informational skill indicator, the average score was at the very high category; on the media awareness, the average score was at the high category; and on the computational thinking indicator, the average score was at the medium category. © 2020, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

In recent years, approaches to personalized learning have been considered to be particularly promising in this regard. A clearly defined concept of personalized learning is still lacking, however. Rather, it serves an umbrella term for educational approaches that try to do justice to the individual abilities, knowledge and learning needs of each student. Our study deals with theoretical dimensions of this multilayered concept and investigates the in-school use of digital technologies for personalized learning as reported by students in connection with their self-assessed digital skills and beliefs about the usefulness of ICT in learning. For this purpose, we have analyzed data from a survey of N = 860 students (8th grade) from 31 Swiss schools that have introduced personalized learning concepts. A structural equation model shows that increased reported use of digital technologies in learning environments that are characterized by open teaching methods is an important aspect of personalized learning because it has a positive effect on both self-reported digital skills and self-perceived ICT-related beliefs in learning. At the same time, the experienced freedom of choice in learning activities that include digital technologies, which is often considered a crucial dimension of personalized learning, has no significant effect.                          © 2019},

	abstract = {In a poll (ReImagineEdu, 2016) looking at the digital profile of nearly 1,000 learners, it was reported that 78% of students worry about digital technologies distracting them from study. In attempting to contribute to this emerging debate (Aaron & Lipton, 2018), this article investigates the experiences, perceptions and awareness of undergraduate language learners (n = 215, over a 3-year period) of the distractive nature of technology and the discerned impact upon their own student language learning and performance. The study is based on data gathered from university language students engaged in a specific language technology module. The module, inter alia, sought to develop awareness of the time spent online by participants while using a number of resources. A mixed-methods approach was employed to conduct this research where qualitative and quantitative data emerged respectively from individual student blogs, reflective reports of their blogging experiences, group interviews and questionnaires. Our outcomes reveal a severe lack of student awareness on the final amount of time they spent online, this being due to a number of factors. However, there is some awareness and perception on their part of how heavily disruptive technology can be for their language learning. Our final conclusions include several recommendations and propose a deictic critical digital literacy for dealing with such distractions - we are calling this a strategic agentive literacy. © European Association for Computer Assisted Language Learning 2020.},

The present study investigated the effects of a structured storytelling approach on the development of young children’s literacy and digital literacy skills. Three classes in two public kindergartens participated in an experimental study involving 62 children, aged 5–6 years. Each classroom was assigned to one of three experimental conditions. In one classroom, the children engaged in their regular literacy activities. In a second classroom, literacy development was supported with storytelling and associated play-based activities, while in the third classroom, children engaged in digital storytelling and activities. Outcomes were assessed by tests of early literacy and digital literacy skills before and after the 6-week intervention. The findings showed that both storytelling conditions significantly enhanced children’s literacy and digital literacy skills. Structured storytelling activities provide a viable and valuable way to enhance literacy and digital literacy in early childhood education. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

In this regard, concepts retrieved from the domain of Organization Development offer a great potential to facilitate change processes and to enhance learning among practitioners. The notions of Learning Organization and Quality Management are combined with the theory of Argyris and Schön’s Levels of Learning. This combination then serves as a theoretical decision-making base used in a simulation game at the University of Applied Sciences OTH Regensburg. Within this scenario-driven exercise, Quality Management, virtual collaboration and digital skills are trained. During the simulation game, participants are encouraged to think critically, to utilize new technologies and to apply their problem-solving skills to real-life examples, which ultimately aims at preparing students for a dynamic working environment within the era of digitization. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.},

	abstract = {Background: Continual development of the social care workforce is a key element in improving outcomes for the users of social care services. As the delivery of social care services continues to benefit from innovation in assistive technologies, it is important that the digital capabilities of the social care workforce are aligned. Policy makers have highlighted the importance of using technology to support workforce learning and development, and the need to ensure that the workforce has the necessary digital skills to fully benefit from such provisions. Objective: This study aims to identify the digital capability of the social care workforce in Northern Ireland and to explore the workforce’s appetite for and barriers to using technology for learning and development. This study is designed to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the digital capability of the social care workforce in Northern Ireland? (2) What is the workforce’s appetite to participate in digital learning and development? and (3) If there are barriers to the uptake of technology for learning and development, what are these barriers? Methods: A survey was created and distributed to the Northern Ireland social care workforce. This survey collected data on 127 metrics that described demographics, basic digital skills, technology confidence and access, factors that influence learning and development, experience with digital learning solutions, and perceived value and challenges of using technology for learning. Results: The survey was opened from December 13, 2018, to January 18, 2019. A total of 775 survey respondents completed the survey. The results indicated a workforce with a high level of self-reported basic digital skills and confidence. Face-to-face delivery of learning is still the most common method of accessing learning, which was used by 83.7% (649/775) of the respondents; however, this is closely followed by digital learning, which was used by 79.0% (612/775) of the respondents. There was a negative correlation between age and digital skills (rs=−0.262; P<.001), and a positive correlation between technology confidence and digital skills (rs=0.482; P<.001). There was also a negative correlation between age and the perceived value of technology (rs=−0.088; P=.02). The results indicated a predominantly motivated workforce in which a sizable portion is already engaged in informal digital learning. The results indicated that lower self-reported basic digital skills and confidence were associated with less interest in engaging with e-learning tools and that a portion of the workforce would benefit from additional basic digital skills training. Conclusions: These promising results provide a positive outlook for the potential of digital learning and development within the social care workforce. The findings provide clear areas of focus for the future use of technology for learning and development of the social care workforce and considerations to maximize engagement with such approaches. © Jonathan Synnott, Mairead Harkin, Brenda Horgan, Andre McKeown, David Hamilton, Declan McAllister, Claire Trainor, Chris Nugent.},

Information from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey and a survey conducted by the Social Care Institute for Excellence and the British Association of Social Workers supported the empirical analysis. The main findings reveal a gap between the level of digital skills required in the labour market and the actual level of digital skills in both young people and social workers, despite efforts by both groups to improve their skills. Initiatives to foster digital skills are therefore recommended to bridge this digital divide. Lastly, it was concluded that both groups could act as mutual drivers of digital transformation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Overall, 90% of students rated their basic computer knowledge and skills as at least "competent" including performing basic troubleshooting, using the Internet, and conducting online literature searches. However, only 55% of students considered their overall applied computer skills as at least "competent," which included using applications for diagnostic coding and to extract data from clinical data sets. Students have digital literacy in everyday settings; however, their ability to translate this into practice is limited, restricting their access to and use of digital tools in the workplace.

	abstract = {In November 2014, the State Secretary for Education, Culture, and Science of the Netherlands officially launched an online country-wide consultation about the future of Dutch education. Based on the outcomes and the ongoing debate, the Netherlands started the development of a new curriculum framework for primary and secondary education in 2018. One of the new themes in this curriculum is digital literacy, which is defined as a combination of ICT skills, media literacy, information literacy, and computational thinking. Together with other subjects such as languages and mathematics, digital literacy will be part of the design of the new curriculum. A teacher design team for digital literacy developed a vision and elaborated this in eight big ideas. Based on the big ideas learning trajectories were designed. These learning trajectories describe what students should learn in primary and secondary education. Schools were involved in the design process from the start. It is expected that the mandatory curriculum framework will be implemented in the year 2022. © 2019 by IGI Global.},

	abstract = {Background: Today's medical students are growing up in a digital age in which the use of smartphones and smart devices is now irrevocably part of professional life. However, the abilities to use these devices that have become so ubiquitous in private life can only be partially transferred to work with patients and the medical setting. Since little is known about digitalization in medical education, the aim of this paper is to gain an overview of the current training in digital competencies at Swiss universities. Methods: The medical deans at all Swiss universities were contacted by telephone and informed about an online survey. The invitation to fill out the Survey Monkey questionnaire was subsequently sent by email to the specific contacts at each university. The survey consisted of questions to be answered using a defined scale and open-ended questions. The survey's focus, topics involving digital competencies, is based on the content in the Principal Relevant Objectives and Framework for Integrative Learning and Education in Switzerland (PROFILES) and the National Competency-based Catalogue of Learning Objective in Undergraduate Medicine (NKLM). Results: All of the dean's offices that were contacted participated in the survey. The topics on digitalization were all rated as relevant or very relevant. Our survey shows a heterogeneous picture in terms of implementing PROFILE and NKLM content. A few universities have well-established educational approaches or even implemented curricula, but often these are still in development. Participants also mentioned factors that are necessary for successfully setting up and implementing curricula dealing with digitalization and factors that can impede such efforts. Conclusion: The importance of acquiring digital competencies during medical study is known and recognized by all Swiss medical schools. Curricular integration varies in its progress and represents major challenges for the medical faculties. It is precisely the inclusion of students in such efforts that may be a potential response to this challenge. Copyright © 2020 Hautz et al.; Hintergrund: Die derzeitigen Medizinstudierenden wachsen in einem digitalen Zeitalter auf, aus dem der Umgang mit Smartphones und Smart Devices im beruflichen Alltag nicht mehr wegzudenken ist. Die Fähigkeiten im Umgang mit diesen Devices, die im privaten Alltag wie selbstverständlich angewendet werden, lassen sich jedoch nur teilweise auf die Arbeit mit Patienten und das medizinisch-professionelle Umfeld übertragen. Da bisher wenig zum Thema Digitalisierung im Medizinstudium bekannt ist, ist das Ziel dieser Arbeit, einen Überblick über die derzeitige Ausbildung in digitalen Kompetenzen an den Universitäten der Schweiz zu erhalten.Methoden: Die medizinischen Dekanate aller Schweizer Universitäten wurden telefonisch kontaktiert, mit dem Hinweis auf eine Online Umfrage. Die Einladung für diese in Survey Monkey implementierte Umfrage wurde im Anschluss per E-Mail an die entsprechenden Ansprechpartner verschickt und bestand aus einem Skalenanteil und Freitextfragen. Der in der Umfrage abgefragte Themenkomplex „digitale Kompetenzen“ orientiert sich an den Inhalten, wie sie im Principal Relevant Objectives and Framework for Integrative Learning and Education in Switzerland (PROFILES) und dem Nationalen Kompetenzbasierten Lernzielkatalog Medizin (NKLM) genannt werden.Ergebnisse: Alle befragten Dekanate haben an der Umfrage teilgenommen. Die genannten Themen aus dem Bereich der Digitalisierung werden allesamt als relevant oder sehr relevant bewertet. Unsere Umfrage zeigt ein heterogenes Bild bezüglich der Umsetzung dieser Inhalte. An wenigen Universitäten ist eine gut etablierte oder sogar curricular implementierte Ausbildung vorhanden, oft aber ist sie im Aufbau. Zusätzlich benannten die Teilnehmer förderliche und hinderliche Faktoren bezüglich des Aufbaus und der Umsetzung curricularer Implementation zum Thema Digitalisierung.Schlussfolgerung: Die Bedeutung des Erwerbs digitaler Kompetenzen im Rahmen des Medizinstudiums ist allen medizinischen Fakultäten in der Schweiz bekannt. Die curriculare Integration ist unterschiedlich weit fortgeschritten und stellt die Fakultäten vor große Herausforderungen. Gerade der Einbezug Studierender in die entsprechende Lehre scheint eine mögliche Antwort auf diese Herausforderung zu sein.},

	abstract = {Most people from rural and township areas in South Africa do not have skills in utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), particularly those who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive. © 2019, © 2019 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.},

The data was collected using a survey method which involved all 42 physics education students. The data analysis was carried out in two stages, namely the categorization stage and the correlation stage. Based on the data and analysis, it is known that the metacognition skill of physics education students is dominated by the “high” category with 40.47%, followed by the “medium” category at 35.71%, and the remaining 23.82% are at “low” category. As for the digital literacy, the variable is not much different from the metacognition skill, which is dominated by students with high category digital literacy skills at 42.85%, “moderate” category at 33.33%, and the rest 23.82% are at “low” category. Likewise, in the variable conceptualization of the concept of physics and physics learning strategies, physics students who are in the “high” category is more dominant than the “medium” and “low” categories, which are 33.33% and 28.58%, respectively. Based on the ANOVA table, it is known that the value of sig. 0,000, which is less than (<) 0.05. It can be said that X1 (metacognition) and X2 (digital literacy) simultaneously affect the Y variable (mastery of the MSPL concept).

This research is an alternative solution to the students’ Skills and awareness to utilize and integrate technology in learning physics. The subject of this research is early semester students who took a basic physics course. The sample of the research is 71 students majoring in physics education from Universitas Negeri Padang (UNP) and Universitas Islam Negeri Imam Bonjol (UIN IB). Data on digital literacy Skills is obtained through performance observation and assessment of structured task reports during the learning process. The instruments used are observation sheets and analytic rubrics. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics interpreted in 4 rating scales, they are: very good, good, fair and poor. Based on the results of the observation at the stage of the project, project and practicum tests, there were 13% of students experiencing little difficulty in using, managing and evaluating information data from the technology software or platform for physic learning. The analysis result of research samples from UNP and UIN IB respectively suggests that 20% and 23% of students achieve very good predicate in information literacy skills, the good predicate has a considerable portion of 64% and 69%, The remaining 16% and 8% fall into the fair predicate. On the assessment of media literacy, there were 18% and 12% of students who fall into a very good predicate of 78% and 81% and 4% and 8% fall into the good predicate. For very good predicate, ICT literacy Skills has 22% and 15% of students, while 62% and 62% of the students fall into good predicate. Besides, the rest of 16% and 23% of the students fall into the fair predicate. The conclusion of the achievement of these three literacies show that the digital literacy Skills achieved by students of UNP and UIN IB is said to be at a good level of 77% and 76%. The findings in this research are highly relevant and interesting in the world of education because the application of PROTECTIVE learning is one of the best solutions for teachers, lecturers and education managers to build digital literacy Skills for the participants in the 21st century. © IJSTR 2020.},

The first step of the study was used to develop and validate an efficient measure of students' perceptions of their DL skills. Step 2 was employed to check the research hypotheses by a quasi-experiment interventional study design. To this end, data were gathered from two groups: research and control (which has not experienced the intervention), both groups were Education students. Participants’ perceived DL skills and creative self-concept (CSC) were surveyed twice – before (pretest) and after (posttest) a three-month intervention. Lastly, qualitative data were collected and analyzed (Step 3) to better understand the quantitative data results. Results revealed significant differences between the pre/post tests only for the research group on the DL and CSC factors – the scores at the posttest were higher than the pretest. Non-significant differences were indicated between the tests for the control group. Results also indicated significant low to moderate connections between the DL and CSC factors. The qualitative data analysis revealed four main categories pertaining to DL skills; technology-enabled collaboration; perceived creativity; and transfer of knowledge and skills. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Smart learning, based on cultural, civic or community interests and placed within a context of ad-hoc urban learning experiences set in authentic learning hyper-local environments might support and develop citizen digital literacies and competences through a wide variety of informal learning activities. This kind of technologically mediated learning acts as an implicit conduit to channel the development of a number of skills and literacies involved in the use of digital apps and devices, and the manipulation of knowledge content both digitally created as well as consumed. Additionally, development of ‘soft’ skills such as community participation, confidence building and language literacy are increased in digitally connected spheres, enabling citizens to act with more self assured agency within these territories. The paper refers to the author’s own doctoral research findings developed from a phenomenographic investigation into smart learning journeys to suggest a ‘pedagogy of experience complexity’ for smart learning as support for these kinds of learning activities. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Based on field observations, it seems that students basically have problems in developing digital literacy. This competence is useful to deal with explore information due to the rise of the internet. Students need to be trained in their digital literacy competencies to analyze digital information content effectively and responsibly. Therefore there needs to be an innovation to develop learning that adapts to the times. This study aims to determine the needs for the development of learning that is interesting, effective, independent and efficient. Learning development that will be carried out is integrated learning design based on google classroom. The subjects of this study were students who took integrated learning courses in 6th semester primary teacher education program. Data collection techniques used were questionnaires and interviews. The results of the study show that integrated learning design based on Google classroom is needed to improve student digital literacy. © 2019 IEEE.},

This research was conducted at Sma Batik 2 Surakarta and interviewed with expert speakers. The results showed that: 1) The application of digital literacy in Pancasila education and citizenship learning is with 3 stages namely planning, implementation, and assessment. Planning comes from a learning implementation plan that is integrated with the concept of digital literacy. The implementation phase is to implement various innovative learning models that can foster digital literacy capabilities in students to reduce the spread of hoax news. The assessment stage is that the teacher assesses the knowledge and attitude of the student. 2) The obstacles in this study are the lack of student ability and the lack of creativity of teachers in learning. The solution to overcome these barriers is to provide learning innovations that can further foster student stimulus to meet the ability in digital literacy and provide workshops and training to teachers to master digital media properly. © 2020 ACM.},

The article analyzes foreign and national approaches and strategies to the development of teachers’ digital competences. The results of the study, aimed to determine the features of mastering digital competencies in the process of teachers’ professional development and their lifelong learning, are presented. In total, 258 teachers from Ternopil and Ternopil region (Ukraine) took part in this research. The study combines a variety of statistical tools and techniques in the real contexts of higher education. The research has been carried out to determine the characteristics of elements that measure the digital competency of the professional development. The results were processed based on the Item Response Theory (IRT). This article demonstrates the utility of the standardized LD χ2 statistic and the M2 statistic as provided in the software IRTPRO, but not available readily in most IRT programs and not discussed commonly in pedagogical papers for IRT.

After the disintegration of the USSR, the paths of education development in former Soviet republics divided. However, there are still many similarities due to the inter-government cooperation and integration projects such as the Eurasia Economic Union. The study aims to understand how PR-education in Russia and Kazakhstan is developing. In particular, the study compares BA and MA education programs comparing courses in common and not in common. This project uses both quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, but is rooted in a qualitative epistemological position that recognizes the importance of locating the research within a particular social, cultural, and historical context. The authors place an emphasis on the competences in the sphere of digital public relations, assuming that skills in information technologies and digital literacy are crucial for success in the future. In order to understand dynamics of PR-education development, the authors compare statistics on student submission to the institutions of the higher education both in Russia and Kazakhstan. The numbers show that there is a big demand in PR-education in terms of students submitted and in terms of competition. In order to indicate what digital skills is needed a survey method is applied. The authors have conducted a survey with 60 BA and MA students. The survey shows that students consider their decision to become a PR-specialists as 'strategically right', but the opinion on digital literacy was controversial. © 2019 IEEE.},

This article contributes to a notion of digital literacies as agentic and transformative and having epistemological implications. Although studies in digital literacies have examined diverse forms of understanding and relating to digitalization, we find that few studies have adopted a principled approach to transformative enactment of digital literacies. Our analytic focus is on how agents turn to digital (and other) resources when faced with problems in order to make them manageable. We conceptualize this notion of digital literacies by drawing on the Vygotskian principle of double stimulation. To demonstrate how agentic and transformative literacies appear in technology-rich learning environments, we make use of an empirical setting in which lower secondary school students and their teacher face a conundrum in a science project. We use this case as an empirical carrier of the conceptual and analytical framework employed. The analysis shows how the teacher enacts digital literacies in the design and orchestration of student activities in technology-rich learning environments where unforeseen issues occur, and how the collaborating students enact digital literacies by drawing on resources that enable them to resolve their insufficient understanding of a problem to reach insights that are shared with their peers. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

Bringing together feminist methodologies in rhetoric and writing with feminist conversations in surveillance studies, Hutchinson and Novotny argue that a feminist surveillance as care pedagogy teaches professional writing students a user-centered design practice that supports consent and user agency, and resists ubiquitous, non-consensual surveillance of user's bodies. Their pedagogy centers on acquisition of critical digital literacies as necessary for teaching students to engage with emerging technological issues, specifically ones raised when considering the ethical implications with surveillance and privacy. The two courses outlined in this article approach wearable technologies through the lens of rhetorics of health and medicine, enabling the kind of critical digital literacies needed to interrogate privacy and surveillance concerns that impact students—a demographic most often targeted as users of these technologies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Having digital literacy requires more than just the technical ability to operate digital devices properly; it also comprises a variety of skills that are utilized in executing tasks in digital environments, such as information skills, socio-emotional skills, cognitive skills and reproduction skills that the learner needs to master in order to use digital environments effectively. This research aim is to propose a learning process model to enhance digital literacy using critical inquiry through digital storytelling (CIDST). The research methodology was divided into two phases: the first phase involves document analysis and synthesis to develop the learning process model and the second phase involves evaluating the suitable learning model by experts. From the results, we anticipate that our learning process model could be used for reference on the part of teachers planning and implementing instructional activities to enhance the digital literacy of undergraduate students. © 2019, Kassel University Press GmbH.},

Information disseminated in the digital world is not always true and valid, thus vocational students as prospective professional workers should be equipped with digital literacy skills. One effort to improve student's digital literacy skills is by applying blended learning model that combines conventional learning model (face-to-face) with online learning model based on Learning Management System (LMS). This study aims at discovering whether there is a significant difference between control classes that apply conventional models with experimental classes that apply blended learning model. The research method used was Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design with 3 experimental classes and 3 control classes. The results of this study indicate that there are significant differences in digital literacy skills between the control classes and the experimental class, which means that the implementation of blended models can improve students' digital literacy skills. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Science and technology is very rapidly growth in the current era of globalization. With the ease of disseminating information both print media and the internet, knowledge and technology development is increasingly fast. The development of science and technology is increasingly advanced, allowing humans to live in an industrial climate by maximizing the functions of technology to replace the humans' roles. When science and technology increasingly allows humans to produce advanced technologies, the digital technology progresses allow humans to live in information society. A concept that generally explains how the community in relation both information and communication activities is facilitated by the modern products ability as the internet supporting by computer products. Computer is the tool that can facilitate and explore the human capabilities in learning and processing information. Thus, the advancement of information technology can affect a person's life in tracking information. Based on the previous elaborations, the writer concern on the current study entitled "The Effect of Digital Literacy on Entrepreneurial behaviours through Entrepreneurial Intention of Students in Economic Education Study Program in Jember ». Hopefully, the world of education in both general and higher education can take the roles in contributing the entrepreneurship from the cognitive, affective and psychomotor for students, so students have entrepreneurial behaviours. This study aims to examine empirically the causal relationship between two variables, namely digital literacy (computer literacy and internet literacy) on entrepreneurial behaviours, and entrepreneurial intentions. This study is explanatory research to find and explain causal relationships between variables. Besides, this study is conducted to answer the problems that have been formulated, the objectives to be achieved, and to test the hypothesis. This study was survey methods by distributing questionnaires to obtain information and the approach is a quantitative approach. The data analysis was Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis. Based on the results, it was found that the digital literacy of students in economic education study programs in Jember was still limited to influence the intention of entrepreneurship, especially on entrepreneurial behaviours. However, the intention of entrepreneurship is proven to mediate digital literacy towards entrepreneurial behaviours. Therefore, the writer suggested that learning is more effective and can be more meaningful for students, preferably focused on both practical and theoretical. Based on the interview results, the proportion of practical learning activities is only around 30% and the theory is 70% of learning. These conditions should be reversed, precisely 30% of theory and 70%, practice especially the practice of entrepreneurship with digital media, for example e-commerce, including the practice of marketing strategies in the marketplace, market space, social media, e-mail, and others. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

To assess readiness, reported levels of competencies were related to the three dimensions of successful collaborative learning described by the Community of Inquiry model. Despite some key differences between students and teachers, general findings include moderate-to-low levels of self-reported technical, social and informational competency, accompanied by consistently low levels of epistemological competency. These findings suggest that neither students nor teachers are adequately prepared for achieving high levels of social, cognitive and teaching presence in a fully online learning environment.

	abstract = {Digital literacy is essentially an indispensable skill as technology is rapidly evolving and so is advancement in information resources, especially digital resources. As the use of digital resources continue to rise within higher institutions of learning, students are expected to develop the required digital literacy skills. Digital literacy skill is a basic requirement for students to function effectively in the information society, which is experiencing a paradigm shift from print resources to digital resources. Hence, digital literacy skill becomes very important since the use of digital resources depend on the competences in using digital resources. In the fast-growing knowledge society, information literacy has become one of the most important skills. This is because students with research information needs will most likely use digital resources if they have the skills required for their effective usage. Whilst information literacy seems to be a term that is mostly associated with higher education, its application to digital resources is yet to be widely exploited. In order to foster the development of digital literacy skills through institutional curriculum, this study explores the dimensional constructs of digital literacy with the aim of having students who can use digital tools to advance learning and keeping up with changing technologies as well as become global digital citizens. The dimensional constructs of digital literacy as outlined in this study are important in the use of digital resources because of the proliferation of digital information presently experienced due to a series of developmental digital activities in our world. © 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice.},

The sample comprised 1,126 specialists in Information Technology, Computer Technology, Computer Education, Computer Science, and Computer Engineering working in public higher education instructions throughout the country. The selection was the result of multi-stage random sampling from 76 public higher education instructions that offer undergraduate education. The instrument was a questionnaire form on essential digital competency components for undergraduate students in higher education institutions. The question items employed a 7-point Likert scale and showed Cronbach's alpha values for the content validity and reliability at a range of.93-.97 per domain and .87-.99 per component. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics for general data and 2nd Order CFA analysis. The findings revealed that from 24 observed variables, there were 7 competency components.: 1) Fundamental of digital; 2) Accessing digital information; 3) Using digital information; 4) Creating digital information and media; 5) Communicating digital information; 6) Managing digital information; and 7) Evaluating digital information.

This paper presents the quantitative findings of an ongoing longitudinal mixed methods study designed to identify and describe these relationships. Structural equation modeling is used to test competing two-wave panel models using online survey data from 181 participants. The results support the acceptance of a model with significant positive reciprocal relationships between DL component constructs and the SRL construct. We contribute, via empirical evidence, to clarifying the direction and extent to which DL and SRL skills of undergraduates influence each other within PLEs.

Responding to these changes, media and digital literacy have been at the centre of a global policy push to articulate a curricular plan for twenty-first century skills, resulting in numerous frameworks produced by non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations and adopted by national governments. At the same time, scholars have been critical of the overwhelmingly economic rationale behind twenty-first century competencies and of the influence of global edu-business on national education policies, calling for critical analyses that examine the local uptake of globally mobile policy initiatives. This paper investigates media and digital literacy at the nexus of global twenty-first century education initiatives and their local interpretation within Singapore’s education system, with special attention to the role of creative digital production. Drawing on a critical analysis of both international and Singapore policy, as well as empirical data on teacher and student practice, I highlight the selective process of localization and its impact on twenty-first century competencies in Singapore. © 2017 National Institute of Education, Singapore.},

The 16 activities we have collected are mostly targeted at the school population and show an emphasis on media production, a dimension that is often not considered part of formal learning, which is more focused on reading than on writing. The results lead us to raise questions about the importance of non-formal education. Interestingly, most of these initiatives have been designed to take place in the school context and are, in various ways, supported by the Ministry of Education, a situation which blurs the boundaries between formal and non-formal learning. The analysis of the data leads us to this specific recommendation: these initiatives should be formally evaluated in order to understand their real impact on the acquisition of news media education skills. © 2017, Padova University Press.

	abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have considerably increased the information and communication channels, favoring the emergence of new models for social relations, such as social networks. However, for elderly users whose learning has traditionally been based on linear models of information such as textbooks, unfamiliarity with Internet can be a barrier. Moreover, elderly people living in rural communities face a lack of telecommunication infrastructures, which increases their difficulties in accessing ICTs. The aim of this study is to test a social network consisting of multiple applications with linear navigation as a digital literacy method for the elderly in rural areas. A sample of 46 participants between 60–76 years old with heterogeneous previous experience with ICTs participated in the study. They performed eight standardized sessions in an Elderly Leisure Center. Results showed differences in perceived usefulness between users with high and low ICT experience. After eight training sessions, the majority of the participants were able to independently use all the system applications, and positive results were obtained on the variables measured, i.e., learnability, sense of control over the system, ability to use the system, orientation, efficiency, accessible design, perceived ease, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. The participants with previous experience with other ICT methods preferred the linear navigation method because they thought it was easier than other ICTs. The results showed interaction differences when touch screens were used. Qualitative results showed that one of the most frequent emotions at the beginning of the ICT sessions was “fear” (related to breaking the computer or to making fools of themselves), but the continued use of the system improved the users’ perceptions of their own capacity to handle ICTs and their interest in ICTs in general. The main contribution of this work consists of exploring the usefulness of linear navigation and social network systems in the context of digital literacy for elderly users in rural areas. © 2018},

Digital literacy instructors face the challenge of teaching students to compose in the technologies currently available, while also supporting students’ future literacy acquisition in technologies that do not yet exist. Focusing on broad digital composing processes and theoretical concepts such as the layer provides a means of preparing students to consider composing for wearable devices and other technologies that continue to emerge. In this article, I explore the use of one Augmented Reality (AR) software as a means of supporting students composing AR, as well as becoming familiar with concepts relevant to other composing occasions. I present a scaffolded process involving analysis and composition, focusing instruction and discussion on the composing concept of the layer. Throughout I emphasize how the concept of the layer extends beyond the visual layers of AR to a composing strategy and thus supports composers developing critical media awareness and adaptability for approaching multiple, potentially unfamiliar, media in current and future contexts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The following paper reports about virtual learning in the field of information processing with the learning objective of increasing students’ digital literacy. The conceptual design of the respective course is based on different learning approaches like self-regulated learning, small group learning as well as face-to-face teaching and is realized within the scope of a faculty wide blended learning programme called MUSSS. Online and on campus-tutors support and supervise students especially while practicing their skills. To support self-regulated learning phases a mobile app has been designed which is able to connect to the LMS. In order to motivate students and to give them feedback about the solved tasks, gamification elements are implemented in an app. Furthermore a study, based on a student survey (n=86), was carried out in order to evaluate the respective course. Results show that, although on a general basis students regarded the course positively (for example concerning its up-to-dateness and the spreadsheet analysis), most of them considered its workload and level of difficulty inappropriate. © The Authors, 2018.

To enter successfully into the digital community, there is the need of enhancing digital literacy for all Thai citizens especially the youths who have already blended their daily life with the internet. Like any literacies, digital literacy requires practicing. Therefore, it is necessary to design and development of training or learning course for anywhere and anytime learning. Moreover, it is challenging to provide the appropriate lesson for each person because they need the different level of digital literacy for their goal. This paper proposes the mobile learning for enhancing digital literacy of Thai youths. Through mobile application, the youth learners feel more comfortable and freedom for their learning. The preference and the performance of students are used for personalization support. The experiment is conducted with 100 primary school students in Chiang Rai province, Thailand. The comparison results of pre-test and post-test reveal that the proposed personalized mobile learning can enhance the learning efficiency of students significantly. At the same time, most of the students have satisfied with the personalization learning in the "satisfy" level. © 2018 IEEE.},

As the world becomes increasingly digital and technologically connected, the ways in which universities support the development of student digital literacy are critical in order to equip graduates with the knowledge and skills to engage in society meaningfully and productively. Regardless of its importance, given the current landscape where numerous digital literacy frameworks can be found in the literature, the task of effectively teaching and assessing digital literacy within higher education becomes rather complex and challenging. As such, through the preliminary analysis of an online survey conducted at a large Australian university, we investigate academics’ perceptions of digital literacy as one of the graduate learning outcomes. With a successful application to the university’s Central Research Grant scheme, the year-long research was conducted in 2017. This project integrated the online survey as well as Change Laboratory as part of the activity theory framework informing this research. Findings discussed in this paper include understandings about the perceived enablers that potentially allow academics to better teach and assess digital literacy in the future. © 2018 ASCILITE 2018 - Conference Proceedings - 35th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education: Open Oceans: Learning Without Borders},

This analysis employed a quasi-experimental mixed-methods approach guided by a sociocultural theoretical framework. Participants were graduate students (n = 46), and data were collected through pre- and postsurvey instruments. Quantitative analyses were conducted using paired sample t-tests, which revealed statistically significant findings regarding determinants of technology acceptance. Qualitative analyses were conducted using grounded theory analytic techniques, which revealed four core conceptual categories: cautionary aspects and constraints, personal and communal dimensions, learner dispositions, and affordances. A discussion of these categories and examples of supportive data was provided. Based on these findings, implications for adult educators are described regarding strategies to enhance technology acceptance and the design of digital collaborative learning experiences among adult learners. © 2017 International Literacy Association},

As one of the core requirements of the workplace, digital literacy is increasingly being incorporated in higher education curricula. This paper aims to depict the level of digital literacy of higher education students, based on their own perceptions. The multiplicity of existing definitions for digital literacy constitutes a difficulty in its assessment. Hence, this paper begins by proposing a threefold definition of digital literacy: access to technology, operational competences and conceptual skills. This definition was deconstructed into sets of specific skills that were the subject of an online questionnaire that Portuguese higher education students were asked to complete. The analysis of the students’ self-evaluation in terms of their digital literacy, offered an important insight into their specific strengths and weaknesses when it comes to Information and Communication Technology. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

In the age of the internet economy, speed of access to information is dependent on the young entrepreneurs’ mastery of technological tools that promote access to the right information at the right time. The skills in digital literacy in terms of selection, interpretation and knowledge construction and also in terms of communication and insertion in the digital culture are essential to face the competition and to be competitive. The role of education is important here to prepare literate entrepreneurs. By conducting a qualitative study using a focus group technique with entrepreneurship students at the Tunisian University level, we aimed to deeply explore: (1) the familiarity of the students with Digital Literacy, (2) students’ perception of the knowledge acquired through their education programs and if it seemed to them sufficient compared to the competences that they perceived as necessary for their future job as entrepreneurs. The results show that the concept and the skills it contains were a discovery for the students. The focus group was also an opportunity for students to collectively reflect on their training and their ability to launch themselves as future entrepreneurs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread use of the term digital literacy, there is no common understanding of what it means or what skills and capabilities should be captured within it. The impact for higher education is that the term is misunderstood and significant assumptions are made regarding students’ digital literacy capabilities. The study reported in this paper explores the mismatch between academic expectations and perceptions of students’ digital literacy capabilities. Data was collected via a survey distributed to all Australian higher education institutions. Outcomes indicate that academics expectations are far higher than what they observe of students’ digital literacy capabilities and that digital literacy skills are not being adequately scaffolded and extended through the curriculum. Improving digital literacy outcomes will not occur until responsibility for teaching these capabilities is explicitly expressed and actioned in the context of disciplines and that opportunities are included throughout students’ educational experiences to scaffold digital literacy learning. © 2018 ASCILITE 2018 - Conference Proceedings - 35th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education: Open Oceans: Learning Without Borders},

It argues that fake news is not an isolated phenomenon, but one that needs to be understood in a much broader social, economic and cultural context. It also addresses the practical possibilities and difficulties of teaching in this area. The notion of 'digital literacy' appears to define the phenomenon in technological terms. By contrast, this article suggests that we need a broader notion of media literacy, which is based on critical thinking about the economic, ideological and cultural dimensions of media. Even so, the article suggests, the broader problems that are at the root of the problem of 'fake news' are unlikely to be solved very easily. © 2019 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.},

To that end, a quantitative methodology with an explanatory scope was used, along with a sample size of 203 teachers from a county south of the state of Sonora, Mexico. Four remaining factors from the theoretical review (educative, personal, pragmatic and contextual) were measured and the results obtained show that the variables associated to the personal factor of the professor are those that are able to explain and impact to a greater degree the integration of the program. It concludes the presence of a manifested necessity in regards to the reformulation and development of capacitation programs and awareness over the impact of technology and the benefits that it brings with the purpose of accomplishing the learning process. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Baja California.},

In line with an emergent critique of this approach, the present study investigated the design and effectiveness of a literacy intervention that blended Gagné’s nine events of instructional design with storytelling. Three classes in a public preschool in Indonesia participated in an experimental study involving 45 children, aged 5–6 years. Across 3 weeks, one experimental condition received storytelling activities and a second experimental condition received digital storytelling activities. The control condition received regular literacy classroom activities. Before, and after, the 3-week storytelling intervention, measures of literacy and digital literacy skills were administered to all groups. In the digital storytelling condition, children’s literacy skills increased significantly compared to children in the control condition. Other exploratory data analyses suggested that both types of storytelling activities enhanced digital literacy skills. The findings need to be replicated with an extended series of storytelling activities that involve larger groups of participants. © 2018, The Author(s).},

In an increasingly regulated and standards-based higher education environment, however, there is a lack of clear guidance as to what constitutes the nature of appropriate level of Digital Literacy that graduates need to demonstrate. This paper argues for the designing framework for developing a learning environment to enhance Digital Literacy in the higher education curriculum, which can then be applied to student activities and the curriculum. This process can be used to assist academics in identifying the literacy requirements of their courses, their own opportunities for professional development and the creation of appropriate classroom pedagogies. The present study found that the taxonomy for the design and development of learning environments constituted elements of learning environments which facilitated students creation of knowledge. Such taxonomy also consisted of elements of Digital Literacy which were learning tasks which helped students enhance Digital Literacy. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article reports on a two-year, funded, qualitative inquiry into the challenges and possibilities of integrating video production into pre-service teacher education as a critical digital literacy practice. This includes the skills, knowledge, and dispositions that lead to ability to critique and create digital texts that interrogate the self, the other, and the world (Ávila & Zacher Pandya, 2013). Video making holds out enormous potential given our increasingly diverse classrooms and the growing need to have students connect and collaborate within their own communities and globally (Dwyer, 2016; Ontario Ministry of Education, 2015, 2016; Spires, Paul, Himes, & Yuan, 2018; Watt, 2017, 2018; Watt, Abdulqadir, Siyad, & Hujaleh, 2019). Video is especially significant in light of the fact that it is replacing print text as a dominant mode of communication (Manjou, 2018). Multimodal composing such as video production is, in fact, considered by some to be the essential 21st century literacy (Miller & McVee, 2012), but much remains to be done to bring digital technologies as literacy into the elementary classroom. Qualitative data includes a focus group, questionnaires, observations, and content analysis of teacher candidate videos and instructional plans. This study considers how video production can be integrated into teacher education programs to engage cross-curricular expectations and critical digital literacy perspectives. It responds to the pressing question of how to do teacher education differently in the digital age. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

	abstract = {Digital competence and digital literacy are concepts that are increasingly used in public discourse. However, how the concepts are used and how they are defined remains unclear. This paper presents a systematic review of research where these concepts are used in higher education research. The aim is to establish an understanding of referencing strategy to digital literacy and digital competence over time, disciplines, countries, methods and level of analysis. Three databases were used in the systematic literature review: Web of Science, Scopus and Education Resources Information Centre. We delimited the search to title, abstract and keywords in the databases. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed publications written in English. Initially 107 publications between 1997 and 2017 were found, with 28 addressing digital competence and 79 digital literacy. Our review demonstrates that there is a range of definitions used in higher education research. They vary depending on if the concepts are defined by policy, research or both and whether they focus on technical skills or social practices. This review indicates directions for further research in higher education i) do more research based on critical perspectives to avoid commonsensical use of the concepts, ii) take the development of definitions of these concepts seriously iii) avoid cross-referencing incompatibilities and finally iv) engage in critical investigations regarding the legitimacy of policy over research in the domain of higher education research. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

While this statement seems clear, the commitment and approach of Australian Higher Education institutions to professional learning focused on digital literacies is not. This paper describes initial steps towards clarifying the place of digital literacies in the context of professional learning for higher education staff. The researchers canvassed 31 higher education websites to identify institutional approaches, and conducted a targeted literature review to uncover models and practices that could have transposal value to institutions. This paper reports on which institutions are publicly committed, which units are typically responsible for digital literacy, the reasoning for institutional approaches and key themes in pedagogical designs.

Preschools are a privileged site for observing and analyzing the formation and development of children’s capabilities (Nussbaum, 2000), since the plasticity of the child’s thought begins to be configured as early as preschool and evolves progressively taking into account the perceptive, sociocultural and behavioural conditions emerging from different educational agencies (Piaget, Inhelder, 1950).

To maximize these opportunities it is imperative to understand how learners' technological fluency and self-regulated learning skills are interrelated within PLEs. This paper presents the quantitative findings of an ongoing longitudinal mixed methods study to identify and describe these relationships between digital literacy and self-regulated learning skills. Structural equation modeling is used to test competing models using online survey data from 181 participants in a two-wave panel design. The results support the acceptance of a non-recursive model with significant positive reciprocal relationships between digital literacy component constructs and the self-regulated learning construct. We contribute via empirical evidence, to clarifying the direction and extent to which digital literacy and self-regulated learning skills of undergraduates influence each other. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for theory and practice together with future research opportunities. © 2018 Association for Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose – Introduces the beginning, acting, telling (BAT) model, designed for use in the elementary school classroom and based on the findings of research into information-seeking behavior and information literacy. The BAT model, by its use of visual cues and mnemonic to present stages and actions of the research process helps students to better conceptualize the research process. The BAT model’s identification of cognitive and affective behaviors, and depiction of features of information literacy instruction including the preparation of students to begin actual research and make effective use of the retrieved information, can help pre-service and in-service teachers be aware of strategic consideration of information literacy in the English Language Arts. Design – The research design of the two studies that informed the model, each involving two classes of third-grade elementary school students, was qualitative. Data were collected via participant observation, interviews, artifacts produced by the students, pre-and post-questionnaires, and journals. Findings – The visual presentation of the BAT model along with its use of mnemonic helped students to more easily conceptualize and remember a holistic research process where concrete actions and abstract concepts are related to and influence one another. Use of the BAT model within a project-based inquiry learning environment to teach content helped to reinforce research skills to form a foundation upon which to build in the future. Practical Implications – By presenting the key aspects of the research process in one visual, the BAT model can help students in the earliest grades of elementary school and forward into high school to better conceptualize and navigate the often iterative and complex nature of the research process. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.},

As a result, a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge, the internet, causing the gap to increase between students in the society.

However, this is a complex process which includes a range of strategies, and little is known about how they should be implemented. Methods that can address this complexity are needed to improve understanding of strategies to develop digital competency in teacher training. In this paper, data mining approaches are used to explore this issue, through analysis of preservice teachers’ experiences with six key digital competency strategies. Specifically, association rules analysis was conducted on a questionnaire dataset of 931 preservice teachers’ experiences in their training, with 24 different practices representing the six strategies. Results showed four distinct clusters of associated strategies, which illustrates how the approach was able to reveal some complexity among digital competency strategies. The most important strategies were Authentic Experiences, Instructional Design and Role Models, showing multiple relationships and effects across all four clusters. Implications for practice suggest certain combinations of strategies are necessary to support pre-service teachers’ developing digital competencies. Future directions for research are discussed. © ASCILITE 2019 Singapore University of Social Sciences. All Rights Reserved.},

This article describes an innovative practice of Blended Learning Supported on a Learning Management System (LMS) whose aim is to enable older people developing digital skills through the using of multimedia teaching materials. The sample of older people was made of 53 Old Females (68 ± 7.61) and 28 Old Males (72.5 ± 7.27). 61 older adults participed in the face-to-face workshop on digital literacy and 20 participed in the blended workshop. Later, a Usability Test was summited to the adults who used the LMS. The results showed that the blended workshop is a very good idea as long as it is used as a support system, because if it were adopted in a totally asynchronous manner, they would have difficulties using it due to lack of assistance. © 2018 AISTI.},

In teaching, the process can start from preparing the teaching materials, teaching activities, communicating with students and evaluating student knowledge level. Digital technology can be used to improve and facilitate each stage of this teaching process. However, effectively selecting digital tools for used in each stage can be difficult for teachers especially the ones in non-IT field due to the knowledge of the digital tools, lacking digital skill as well as the limited experiences on how to use them in teaching activities. In many countries, their ministry of education has been providing digital tools and many trainings trying to help teachers to effectively utilize digital tools in their teaching activities; however, the tool selection and the training approach that were used still not effective enough that the tools were used effectively and non-productively in teaching process. This paper reports the result of the developing digital skill for teachers and how they can use digital tools in teaching activities or process. This report is also one part of the major research project supported by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC) of Thailand. The digital tools were collaboratively selected by teachers in the project then trained by researcher team. The tool utilizations in teaching activities are designed, implemented and concluded by community of teachers in the project. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the current context, training of trainers has, as a referent, the professional profile and thus, the teachers' professional competencies. While in the last decades many efforts to study in depth this particular issue have been made, we think this study requires further study, above all from the new training scenarios propitiated by ICT, which are bringing about a complete redefinition not only of the professional profile in terms of new functions and roles, but of their own professional competences and digital competences. This leads us to assume that it is necessary to get deeper into comprehension of the teachers' digital competence structure in order to reorient the sense of their training in the same direction of their professional development, within both initial training and continuous training for its accomplishment, regardless of training scenarios, modality, sequence, resources, evaluation and recognition or accreditation of the training (or the acquisition of digital competence in any other ways: non-formal or informal learning). This concern by the structure of competences is not new but it is recent. It has been from the last decade, concretely since 2008 (ISTE, 2008, although it has prior origins; UNESCO, 2008), as first exponents of the emergence of the efforts of the valuable compilation of teachers' digital competence, developing also further standards about this competence. While there is not a general agreement about it, facing the road of the development of the new teachers' profile - key issue and reference point of a training with sense of direction -, it seems to us a great deal of concern overcoming certain dissemination or basic literacy courses more focused on technical than in pedagogical issues (pedagogical integration of ICT). Moving in this direction and considering these new scenarios, we present a model to integrate the digital competence into the university teacher' professional profile, as well we reflect about some derived implications for the training of trainers. © 2018 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

We examine whether something similar occurs on the Internet, whether the higher educated are more successful in mobilizing help online, and whether this is related to their digital skills and the way in which they use the Internet. With the latter, we link online coping to digital inequality research. Researchers have investigated digital inequalities with regard to skills and types of Internet use. However, we know little about the extent to which these factors translate into inequalities in resources mobilized from the Internet. This latter type of inequality is highly relevant, since it is an intermediary step between Internet use and (improved) well-being and life chances. Using a large sample of individuals living in the Netherlands, we find educational differences in the mobilization of online problem-focused coping resources, but no differences with regard to online socioemotional or disengagement coping resources. The educational inequalities in online coping are somewhat smaller than educational inequalities in offline coping, leading to remarkable consequences for social policy. Furthermore, we find a relatively complex pattern of interrelations between offline inequality (education) and different types of digital inequality (skills, usage, resources). In our conclusions we make a plea for more research on outcomes of Internet use and we discuss the implications of our findings for further research. © 2017 The Author(s).

Chile has the highest levels of accessibility to Information and Comunication Technologies (ICT) in Latin America, but also one of the most unequal educational systems. Both factors are evident in the evaluations regarding the digital abilities of students made in the country. However, these measurements do not allow us to understand how these differences are expressed concerning youth digital practices. This article proposes a conceptual articulation to generate meaning and guide research on digital literacy, and also presents results of an exploratory study of mixed design, aimed to characterise media practices and skills of adolescents from three educational institutions in Santiago, Chile. In a first quantitative phase, a questionnaire was applied to 143 cases, and then qualitative analysis workshops were held with a sample of 30 students. The quantitative results confirm differences in the use of ICT according to socioeconomic level. The qualitative findings allow us to understand these differences and make the definition of digital literacy more complex in about youth practices and agencies. © 2019 PEL.},

	abstract = {Infographics are eye-catching one-page documents that provide a concise overview of a topic through visually representing information or data using graphics, icons and/or images, with minimal words. They are an emerging key form of communication in society, government, research, education and industry, and can be found widely in social media, advertising, teaching, policy documents and scientific journal publications, for example. Due to their user-friendly, quick-read format, infographics are highly influential in shaping the opinions of their audience. An emerging issue with infographics, however, is the capacity to mislead or misrepresent information or data. In the contemporary higher education environment, providing students with digital literacy skills, including the capacity to critically evaluate digital media forms such as infographics, is vital. This paper will provide a review of the use of infographics in learning and teaching in the literature, including as assessment, examining the benefits as well as the potential issues, and how some of these challenges might be met. © ASCILITE 2019 Singapore University of Social Sciences.

However, many studies have only evaluated educational applications that combine some common game design elements—such as points, leaderboards, or levels. Consequently, we still lack studies exploring different ways of designing gameful learning experiences. Therefore, we introduce the design and implementation of a digital system employing a skill tree to mediate instructor feedback and assignment grading in a university course, Additionally, we present the results of a pilot evaluation with 16 students in which we summarized the positive and negative aspects of the experience to derive lessons learned for the use of digital skill trees in similar contexts. Finally, we suggest topics for further investigation. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.},

In contrast to the definition provided by the Office for Information Technology Policy of the American Library Association (ALA, 2013), which refers to digital literacy as a singular ability, the BC definition highlights how digital literacy is not just a technical skill but one that involves “interest” and “attitude”: that is, a certain disposition toward technology use. This distinction underlines how becoming truly digitally literate begins with and is sustained by adopting a mindset that recognizes the power of digital technologies. © 2018 Taylor and Francis.},

Focused on using technology and gadgets along the teaching-learning process, teachers and learners require solid digital literacy skills to guide them through the blended learning formats. The acquisition of language skills today is no longer a simple matter of learning and producing content in the physical school environment, but rather, it has become an elaborate process of combining multiple skills (digital, literacy, visual, technological) and creating the most appropriate frameworks for customised learning. With the specificity of teaching ESP, the challenges that occur within this educational endeavour are many and complex, spanning from learners’ tailored needs to teachers’ tech-saviness. It is therefore the purpose of the current paper to analyse some particularities of ESP teaching based on sharing digital skills, by indicating potential flaws and benefits along the way. The practical viewpoint will be rendered in a brief analysis of the most common and prolific digital tools used to provide aid in teaching specific foundational language skills. © 2019 Transilvanian Association for the Literarure and Culture of Romanian People (ASTRA).

This study, focused on higher education, reviews the readiness literature and positions digital competencies as factors within it. A key limitation identified is that despite the position of digital knowledge, skills and attitudes as highly significant factors, readiness instruments are limited by inconsistent conceptualization and unidimensional operationalization of digital competencies. In response, the General Technology Competency and Use (GTCU) framework and accompanying online Digital Competency Profiler (DCP) application, developed in Canada and used over a decade in several national contexts, are reviewed as an alternative readiness-assessment apparatus. Findings from a pilot observational study comparing: (a) self-reported digital competencies (using DCP indicators), and (b) the quality of authentic digital-learning performances, are highlighted in support. Through continued application development and international collaboration, the researchers are pursuing contextually-sensitive and non-exclusionary readiness-assessment tools that help individuals and groups better prepare for successful digital learning. © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to present the current situation of digital competence in the updated curriculum and the textbooks in accordance with the main philosophy of basic education in 2017. For this purpose document analysis was used as the research method to investigate the level of effectiveness of digital competence in the context of time and content by studying the curriculum and the textbooks prepared by MoNE. In this manner curriculum and the textbooks of compulsory lessons were reviewed, and it was concluded that the concept of digital competence was addressed sufficiently. Moreover, it was found that digital competence covered not only in the Information and Communications Technology Lesson, but also in all the other lessons with a wholistic approach in a way that it was given a wide coverage in every lesson as content, subject, learning outcome, warnings, etc. In general, in the updated curriculum the content of digital and technological competence is approached more wholistic and taken more place than the previous version. On the other hand, it was determined that the Information and Communications Technology Curriculum was updated as coding-based and outcome-focused. The fact that a textbook for this lesson was prepared for the first time shows the importance given to this subject. © 2019. All Rights Reserved.},

Expansion of digital technologies is seen as an economic, technological and social development phenomenon. Higher education plays a key role in preparing future generations and exploiting the opportunities of the digital economy, thus it is essential that they actively use the opportunities offered by digitalisation, both in their internal communication and marketing to improve their day-to-day work and thus are able to offer a study process that complies with today’s students’ preferences. The aim of the current research was to assess the use of digitalization possibilities in the study process based on the example of Latvia public universities, focusing on in-depth study of the digital environment of Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies (LLU). The research tasks were: 1) to analyse the digital performance of the European Union Member States; 2) to evaluate external digital performance indicators of Latvia public universities; 3) to assess LLU students’ level of satisfaction with LLU digital environment. The research was performed based on the secondary data analysis, i.e. theoretical literature studies, and author’s practical survey that was conducted at Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. The research revealed that currently digitalization at universities is driven by students who demand that the whole study process and communication is available in the digital environment, and universities need to improve meaningfully the curriculum and study programmes by placing the emphasis on the labour market demands. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

	abstract = {This article examines how the concepts of digital literacies and digital competence are conceptualized in curricula for compulsory education within the Nordic countries. In 2006, the European Union defined digital competence as one of eight key competences for lifelong learning. The terms digital literacies and digital competence have since been used interchangeably, particularly in policy documents concerning education and the digitalization of educational systems and teaching. However, whether these concepts carry similar meanings, and are understood in a similar way, across languages and cultures is not self-evident. By taking the curricula in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway as examples, this article attempts to clarify similarities and differences in how the concepts are interpreted, as well as what implications this has for the digitalization of education. The analyses reveal that different terms are used in the curricula in the different countries, which are connected to themes or interdisciplinary issues to be incorporated into school subjects. The conceptualizations of the terms share a common emphasis on societal issues and a critical approach, highlighting a particular Nordic interpretation of digital literacies and digital competence. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

Data analysis was conducted by correlation analysis, independent sample t-testing, and structural equation modelling. Participants were 916 college students from 10 colleges in South Korea. The results showed that i) no difference between groups existed in digital literacy and core competencies; however, a group difference existed in learning strategy; ii) digital literacy had a direct effect on core competencies and learning strategies had an indirect effect on the influence of digital literacy on core competencies; and iii) digital literacy can enhance the effect of core competencies when mediating learning strategy. This study suggests areas for future research, including developing digital technology-enhanced, competency-driven learning resources that account for the effects of cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management; the relationship between digital literacy and core competencies of learner characteristics such as achievement goal orientation, learning style, and academic self-efficacy; the effect of individual digital technologies on core competencies based on individual learning strategies through experimental and quasi-experimental designs; and qualitative studies on employing digital technologies and learning strategies. © 2019 ESTP.},

These technologies present unique opportunities for supporting creativity, which is the key aim of learning in arts education. Despite the direct and close link between them and arts education, how to integrate these technologies into traditional education has long challenged government and educational experts. Teachers’ digital literacy has been regarded as an important part of information communication technologies-enabled education. Because an arts education uses more equipment than other types of education, it is more dependent on digital media. Thus, arts teachers’ digital literacy has directly affected their teaching, and has played an increasingly important role in education. This paper, having investigated eight Chinese arts teachers’ digital concepts and utilities in their teaching, explores digital literacy in arts teaching in China from different perspectives. It also offers recommendations for research into arts teachers’ digital literacy and arts education research in China for the future.

The European DigComp 2.1 framework for digital skills was used as a way of structuring the inquiry process based on surveys and focus groups. Results showed some differences in perception across groups and a clear focus on information search and communication abilities as priorities, but also to a perceived gap between the needs and the actual abilities of students.

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This paper reports on a case study project which had three goals; to devel-op a suite of original interactive digital skills e-tutorials to be embedded in undergraduate and postgraduate courses; to evaluate the students' experi-ence and engagement with the e-tutorials over one semester; and to ex-plore their general attitudes towards online and blended learning. Background Online and blended learning modes continue to grow in popularity in higher education, with the aim of streamlining and enhancing student learning, supporting collaboration and creativity, and equipping students with the skills they will require to work and live in an increasingly digitized world. This practice-based case study highlights factors which positively and negatively affect user engagement with digital learning objects and ex-plores students' perceptions of the role of online learning within their aca-demic programs. Methodology A suite of nine interactive e-tutorials, addressing essential digital literacy skills for university students, was developed through instructor and student peer collaboration using Articulate software, informed by best practice. The e-tutorials were embedded in the institutional Learning Management System for three undergraduate and postgraduate courses, in which digital literacy formed the core learning content, to complement classroom-based learning. Students in these courses were surveyed via SurveyMonkey about their specific experience of using the e-tutorials, as well as their general perceptions of digital literacy and online learning. Eighty-six students in total completed the questionnaire, which consisted of twenty-three closed- and open-ended questions. Contribution Through highlighting both the positive and the challenging aspects of the students' reported experience of online learning, this case study contrib-utes useful insights to the body of literature on user engagement with digi-tal learning objects in higher education, as well as students' perceptions and experience of blended learning. Findings The e-tutorials were perceived as valuable in reinforcing classroom learn-ing, allowing respondents to revise concepts and materials covered in face-to-face classes, at their own pace and in their own time. Survey responses showed that the accessibility, ease-of-use, design and duration of the e-tutorials were deemed effective in terms of user engagement; however, several technological challenges were identified, such as browser incompat-ibility, uneven sound quality and general Internet connection issues, which disrupted their learning. Overall, students expressed enjoyment of the learning facilitated by the e-tutorials; however, rather than favoring online learning alone, they expressed a preference for a blended learning envi-ronment, with a combination of complementary learning approaches; sur-vey respondents did not generally wish to forego face-to-face classes en-tirely. Recommendations for Practitioners Instructors should seek to strategically embed interactive digital learning objects in their courses at defined points of need in a logical structure, e.g., to reinforce classroom-based learning, or to support specific skill develop-ment. Potential disruption to learning should be minimized by following best practice guidelines to ensure ease of access, a seamless user experi-ence, and timely feedback, as well as providing adequate support for rapid resolution of technical glitches. Recommendations for Researchers E-tutorials offer a useful means of exploring ways in which students ac-quire learning in the digital environment. A wider, collaborative exploration is needed to provide comparative studies which move beyond case studies. Impact on Society Online learning mechanisms, such as e-tutorials, offer students different means of acquiring essential literacy skills and different ways to interact with content. E-tutorials constitute reusable learning objects, which can be accessed as just-in-time delivery modes, when students perceive they need to review particular skills or reinforce learning material. Future Research This research is now expanding into different types of reusable learning objects. E-tutorials may be developed in multiple ways, and comparative research around e-tutorial models will deepen our understanding of how students interact with content in formal learning contexts. As the digital educational landscape continues to expand alongside traditional face-to-face and analogue learning modes, a key research focus will be student and instructor perceptions and experience of blended learning in different con-texts. © 2019, Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice.},

	abstract = {This article arises from the proposal of a new approach regarding the inclusion of soft-digital skills training in higher education. The study carried out on several curricular units in different higher education courses in Portugal led us to reflect on a different educational model, which combines the development of soft skills in digital environments. Digitalization and the use of technologies since early ages in the educational process are raising interesting questions. This article intends to go deeper on the use of digital technologies, namely through the virtual environments imposed by higher education institutions as a form of study. The main question is how pedagogies and the use of technologies have a meeting point where it is possible to continue humanization in education through the utilization of virtual environments to support the teaching/learning process. The methodology used in this study has its support on questionnaires made to students of higher education in different areas of knowledge, such as medicine, nursing, engineering, management, arts and literature. The main conclusions of this study are the importance of creating and using digital platforms that not only support the study but also contemplate the use of a virtual reality where students can interact with others in the discussion and resolution of real life situations. © The Authors, 2019.

The rapidly developing digital economy is increasing the demand for digitally literate individuals. To be digitally literate, one must be equipped with appropraite tools and skills necssary to compete and succeed. Normally people tend to assume that youths are digital natives however exposure to technology alone does not consider as digital literate person. So far there is no established studies that confirm the factors that improve the young individuals to be digitally literate. Purpose of the study is to investigate the factors that impact on young individuals to be digtial literate and also to access the outcomes of digital literacy. Finally this study propose the digital literacy framework that can be implemented in higher education sector in Malaysia. The expected outcome is to identify set of digital skills and styles that young adults should have in order be digitally literate so as to enhance in academic performance and employment opportunities. This study will also contribute to policy and practices as the provided digital literacy framework that can be implemented in higher education sector in Malaysia. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines these issues by investigating female students’ attitudes and expectations with regard to using digital tools in marketing coursework and in a future career. Although students often claim they are confident about using technology, many actually feel discomfort about their preparedness for using technology in career contexts. Females in particular struggle to feel confident about their technological competence. This presents a challenge for marketing instruction, because employers have indicated that digital tools are critical for new marketing careers. Thus, it is incumbent upon marketing faculty to help prepare students for the job market not only by offering instruction on marketing’s theoretical foundations but also by providing hands-on opportunities for students to improve their digital skills and confidence. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

However, the unfaltering popularity of brick-and-mortar courses indicates that direct access to expert knowledge and face-to-face engagements remain key considerations for students. Here we showcase a combination of these two worlds in a Small Private Online Course (SPOC). Compared to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), SPOCs are developed for smaller and more dedicated target groups and depend on close engagement between teachers and students. This format enables educational providers to involve internal and external students and teachers alike and to make ample use of online resources. This paper is based upon our experiences of running a SPOC on ‘Modelling and Simulation in Archaeology’ at Leiden University. We review the process of developing and running the course aimed at teaching archaeology students computer programming skills, while supporting their development as professional archaeologists and responsible academics. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Digital literacy (DL) is a one of the competency recommended for educators to be embedded in the Kenyan Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) in preparation for learners for the 21st century skills. The Ministry of Education deployed devices to lower primary at a ratio of 1 to 1. The aim of the research was to determine the level and frequency of embedding the digital literacy abilities after the teachers and school leaders in a 3-day preparation and 8 weeks of implementation with virtual support through Communities of learning. The methodology was a self-administered survey which evaluated the seven abilities based on the level and frequency of implementation. The dot product of level and frequency were determined as a percentage. The analysis explored the average percentages and the relationship between level and frequency of implementation. The findings revealed that there was a correlation between the level and the frequency of implementation. All abilities where at developing stage on average. The mode and mean on levels and frequency were on average similar apart from few cases where it was above. All the abilities had a bell curve on implementation with access, integrate and evaluate skewed to the right. It can be concluded that despite the deployment of devices there is still very low implementation of DL and there is a significant relationship between the level and frequency of implementation. There is need to interrogate possible factors to low implementation beyond devices and educator preparation with virtual support. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.},

Recognizing this gap in scholarship, I created a series of assignments (The National Digital Literacy Narrative Project) to engage aspiring secondary English teachers in critical considerations of how public rhetoric about technology and literacy complicates composition studies scholarship and the contexts in which they will teach.This article analyzes the NDLN Project and what it teaches writing teachers-and composition studies-about 1) the benefits of analyzing public rhetoric regarding technology and its impact on literacy practices, and 2) the need for graduate programs in composition studies to pay attention to writing teacher education for secondary English teachers. I present the results of the NDLN Project by sharing the stories of three students whose coursework and comments reflect the ideas, experiences, and changing views of the larger group. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In terms of production of teaching materials and teaching activities for the digital environment, it is essential that the teacher knows how to explore some of the tools available in the digital context. This paper aims to: (a) highlight the use of podcasting as a resource on the Internet that allows teachers to plan, to develop and to test activities involving oral production and comprehension of foreign languages; (b) discuss how far activities proposed by this digital resource can contribute to the digital literacy of both teachers and students; (c) report results of the experiment site analysis and production of podcasts involving multiliteracies. To do that, fi rstly, we mapped podcasts' sites on the Internet, as well as we selected and analyzed this technology. Secondly, we proposed a pilot study involving the use of podcast aiming to promote students and teacher's digital fl uency and literacy. The analysis and the experience realized indicated that the use of this resource could contribute signifi cantly not only to language teaching, but also for digital literacy and technological fl uency of both, teacher and student. Therefore, it is necessary to know the educational potentialities of podcasts to develop activities that address the interests and needs of students. Thus, we suggest analysis indicators, which may help the teacher in service both in the selection and analysis of this podcast for use in the classroom, and for the production of activities involving such technology. © 2014 by Unisinos.},

	abstract = {Leveraging the capabilities of the web, which has become hugely popular among university students since its inception in the 90s, blended learning has been promoted as an alternative to classroom learning. A hybrid of classroom learning and online learning, blended learning offers flexibility in the way students learn - when, what, where, and how to learn. The easy availability of mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, etc.), coupled with web-based services (e.g. digital library, learning management systems, etc.), has further fuelled blended learning. Universities see online learning as complementary to classroom learning so as to give students a better learning experience, and students like the learning flexibility. As blended learning expects students to know how to use digital technology to access the web, to search for and to use information from different sources both online and offline, as well as to be an independent learner, it seems reasonable to presume that to be an effective learner in a blended learning environment, students need to have a certain level of digital literacy. Thus, there remains a question: Do students require digital literacy to be effective in learning in a blended learning environment? Answering this question helps universities to understand if high digital literacy is a prerequisite to more effective learning in a blended learning environment. If it is, universities can provide students with workshops to help raise digital literacy among them. Following a quantitative approach, this study conducted an online questionnaire survey to answer the question by examining the relationships between four digital literacy constructs; i.e. underpinnings, background knowledge, central competencies, and attitudes and perspectives; as conceptualised by David Bawden in his 2008 book chapter entitled "Origins and Concepts of Digital Literacy," and effective learning. This study developed a 5-item scale to operationalise each of the four digital literacy constructs and, using the revised Bloom's taxonomy as a point of departure, a 6-item scale for the effective learning construct. To collect responses from the students who were taking subjects in a blended learning environment at a local university, the students were invited to fill in an online questionnaire. Responses were then analyzed using partial least squares. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in the four digital literacy constructs being reduced to three. Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis proved that the three digital literacy constructs each had a statistically significant relationship with the effective learning construct.},

	abstract = {Background: The profession of practicing medicine is based on communication, and as social media and other digital technologies play a major role in today's communication, digital literacy must be included in the medical curriculum. The value of social media has been demonstrated several times in medicine and health care, therefore it is time to prepare medical students for the conditions they will have to face when they graduate. Objective: The aim of our study was to design a new e-learning-based curriculum and test it with medical students. Method: An elective course was designed to teach students how to use the Internet, with a special emphasis on social media. An e-learning platform was also made available and students could access material about using digital technologies on the online platforms they utilized the most. All students filled in online surveys before and after the course in order to provide feedback about the curriculum. Results: Over a 3-year period, 932 students completed the course. The course did not increase the number of hours spent online but aimed at making that time more efficient and useful. Based on the responses of students, they found the information provided by the curriculum useful for their studies and future practices. Conclusions: A well-designed course, improved by constant evaluation-based feedback, can be suitable for preparing students for the massive use of the Internet, social media platforms, and digital technologies. New approaches must be applied in modern medical education in order to teach students new skills. Such curriculums that put emphasis on reaching students on the online channels they use in their studies and everyday lives introduce them to the world of empowered patients and prepare them to deal with the digital world. © Bertalan Mesko, Zsuzsanna Gy rffy, János Kollár.

The purpose of this study is to establish a fundamental measure for the systematic training of digital literacy ethics education based on the survey of student's perception of digital literacy in the first and second year college students. The subjects of this study were 77 students from the first and second years of university. They divided into two groups and took the ethics education of the digital culture society for 14 weeks. For the experiment, group A conducts training appropriate to the topic of each unit and group B emphasizes the role of information receiver and information provider in cyberspace in connection with the topic of each unit and recognizes the importance of digital literacy education in cyberspace i have differentiated teaching and learning methods so that i can do it. As a result of comparing two groups, the group B got higher average score than the group A in the area of technology use ability, information provider and information receiver. In other words, digital literacy-centered digital culture social ethics education showed not only the ability to read information but also the ability to improve communication, information detection ability, SW understanding ability, relationship forming ability, documents editing and utilization ability. Therefore, ethics education centered on digital literacy must be equipped with netizens of digital cultural society which can inspire technical literacy and ethical consciousness. In order for digital literacy to be positioned as the right information communication capability of digital cultural and social ethics education, it is necessary to include the literacy ability that information users and providers voluntarily select and critically accept information in the ethics curriculum. © Medwell Journals, 2017.},

	abstract = {Introduction. This research work describes the difficulties faced by students who are coursing the education masters program, in terms of digital competencies. Objectives. Determine the development level of the digital competencies in students from the education masters program, as a tool for their academic performance. Materials and methods. This is a quantitative empirical study, located at a comparative-descriptive level, in which a census to the 15 education masters program's students at Universidad Autónoma de Tlaxcala, Mexico, was performed. The questionnaire was built with 23 items, divided into three categories: sociodemographic data, accessibility and digital competencies. The collection and the codification of the data were made by the use of the SPSS program and the questionnaire had a 0.801 reliability, according to the internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) of the ítems. Results. The data analysis was first performed per gender, demonstrating that both genders have a high accessibility level to devices and Internet. Also, women spend more time in the network following academic objectives, while men combine the consultation of academic topics with the reading of news in the mass media sites. In general, the level of digital competence of the students is medium but, for working with images, video conferences, wikis or webquest, the habilitation levels are low. Conclusion. The results reveal scarce differences between men and women. It is, nevertheless, necessary that the masters program includes learning and digital competencies development in its study plan, thus benefitting the profesional formation of students.},

In view of these developments, this article argues that the scope of English language teaching be expanded beyond the traditional focus on speech and writing to the production of multimodal ensembles, drawing on a range of other semiotic modes. The article describes an undergraduate course in English for science at a university in Hong Kong, which incorporated elements of digital literacies. Students were engaged in a project to conduct a simple scientific experiment, reporting their findings (1) as a multimodal scientific documentary, shared through YouTube with a general audience of nonspecialists, and (2) as a written lab report aimed at a specialist audience. This article focuses on the multimodal scientific documentaries created by students and evaluates their potential in terms of language learning by drawing on data from student interviews, student comments on a course blog, and the students' documentaries themselves. The analysis shows that students met the challenge of writing for an authentic audience by combining a range of modes (with language playing an important role) to develop an effective rhetorical "hook" and appropriate discoursal identity in their efforts to appeal to their audience. © 2013 TESOL International Association.},

Of the 1500 public individuals examined, 1190 (79.3%) were Internet users and 535 (35.7%) were smart device users. Of the 5300 with disabilities, 2110 (63.9%) were Internet users and 324 (8.8%) were smart device users. Generalized linear modelling showed significant main effects of disability, gender, age and education on Internet use and production literacy. The disability×age and disability×education interaction effects on Internet use literacy were statistically significant. We also observed a significant disability×age interaction effect on Internet production literacy. However, the main and interaction effects of disability, gender and education on smart device use and production literacy were not significant. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

As with other forms of education, high self-efficacy often encourages greater student confidence and autonomy. While self-efficacy has been shown to have positive effects in face-to-face education, its antecedents and consequences in online distance education are less clear. This study addresses this issue. First, it considers two important antecedents: attitude and digital literacy. Second, the study considers the effects of self-efficacy on three important learning behaviors: peer engagement, learning management system (LMS) interaction and course convener interaction. Findings from an online survey of 151 postgraduate business students suggest that positive student attitude and digital literacy significantly contribute to self-efficacy. In turn, self-efficacy has positive effects on peer engagement, learning management system (LMS) interaction and convener interaction. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This paper examines the use of an 'everyday' technology, Facebook, by a small group of sixth form students labelled as dyslexic. 'Levelling the playing field' is a phrase the participants used often when discussing what they wanted from learning technology. Because dyslexia usually is defined in terms of significant difficulties with literacy, we might reasonably anticipate that the participants would see Facebook as stigmatising rather than levelling the playing field, because of the very public literacy events that it demands. However, the data indicate that far from shying away from Facebook because of fear of their difficulties with literacy being exposed, the participants enthusiastically embraced it. The students saw Facebook as a desirable presence in their education, one that supported inclusion. For them, levelling the playing field with Facebook had five dimensions: keeping up to date and meeting deadlines; increased control over learning; developing metacognitive awareness; greater control over literacy process and demands; and being experts and helpers. The findings perhaps challenge some assumptions about dyslexia, literacy and learning, and may be of interest to teachers working with dyslexic students, or researchers studying learning in digitally mediated social networks. © 2014 O.

Digital skills are particularly important for doctoral students whose in-depth research requires the use of technological tools such as databases, content management systems, and citation management programs. Although widely researched in the undergraduate education context, digital literacy instruction has received less attention concerning doctoral students. In addition, little attention has been paid to the effectiveness of citation management tools on educational research. To address these questions, a faculty librarian, library intern, and professor at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor employed a co-teaching model of instruction in an attempt to improve digital searching and citation management to the incoming doctoral cohort. This paper presents a case study that discusses the findings from a mixed-methods approach involving closed-ended and open-ended assessments to determine effectiveness. The co-teaching model offered significant benefits over previous doctoral library instruction methods.},

This is of great interest in scientific literacy and Brossard and Shanahan (2006) developed an instrument to evaluate the understanding of scientific terms and basic science concepts. In this quantitative study we analyse the relationship between Spanish digital mass media and scientific literacy in pre-service primary teachers (N = 189). Results showed that these university students have a term knowledge level lower than the one found by Brossard and Shanahan in the USA. On the other hand, conceptual knowledge was not correlated at all to the term frequency in the Spanish digital newspapers considered. The conclusions suggest that participants do not use digital newspapers to improve their science education so a change in students’ use of those digital media from ludic to educational purposes is needed. © Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2015.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the concept of curation as a student-and creation-driven pedagogical tool to enhance digital and media literacy education. Specifically, it will unpack the phenomenon of curation as a pedagogical model for enhancing civic engagement, community, and purpose within social media platforms. Online curation-an increasingly common way to refer to the act of organizing various content into cohesive online stories-has taken numerous forms in recent years. Media organizations are increasingly integrating such tools into their web presence, most recently seen by the New York Times, NPR and the Washington Post utilizing Storify curation software for multimedia stories; and Al Jazeera, CNN and others integrating Twitter into their regular online programming. Curation is also being explored through remix-the sharing, repurposing, or re-appropriating of content online-as a function of creative commons and copyright, and in terms of cultural production and social structure. This chapter will build a framework for curation as it builds on existing models for digital and media education and remix culture. It will develop curation as a foundational media education competence to teach students about responsibility, purpose, and participation in social media spaces. © Matteo Stocchetti, 2014.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the current state and influential factors in the development of digital literacy of the students in Thailand’s higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The quantitative research method was applied with a survey conducted to collect information from the target group that consisted of administrators, lecturers and students of 116 Thai universities. Respondents included 81 administrators, 500 lecturers and 1,000 students. Findings: The findings revealed that 61.73 per cent of the universities set digital literacy as an undergraduate program policy, 30.86 per cent set it as a student development policy, while 12.35 per cent do not have any policy in this regard. In total, 40.74 per cent of the universities establish digital literacy as the required graduates’ trait, and 22.22 per cent establish it as a graduate’s identity. The study of factors related to digital literacy development showed that the respondents see that all of the factors affect students’ digital literacy development at a high level, including infrastructures, human resources, students’ awareness, external environments, development process, university’s policy and academic management. Originality/value: In Thailand, universities have seen the importance of information literacy development for students at a certain level. However, the concepts of information literacy and digital literacy differ. While information literacy mainly comprises technical skill and information management skill, digital literacy is composed of technical skill, cognitive skill and emotional-social skills. This paper presents the first research on digital literacy development in Thai higher education. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Adopting a survey design, it used a sample of 250 teachers from 10 out of 16 secondary schools in Calabar Municipal Local Government. A researcherdeveloped instrument called Digital Competency Questionnaire (DCQ) was used in data gathering. The DCQ was validated by three experts, and its reliability was established to be 0.86. Findings of the study indicated that the levels of digital competencies of teachers in the use of SNSs and general usage of SNSs by teachers are moderate. It also revealed that the level of application of SNSs in the teaching-learning process is low. Results of the study also indicated significant differences in the level of digital competencies in the use of SNSs based on gender; and in the level of application of SNSs in the teaching-learning process based on age category of teachers. Recommendations were made to the guidance counsellor to improve these levels and bridge the established gaps based on gender and age category of the teachers. © 2016 The Author(s).},

In this study, the authors sought to determine if learning style or digital literacy predict incidental learning, that is, learning that occurs without learners being instructed to attend to or learn presented information. One hundred and fifty-five education undergraduate students completed a series of tasks in a virtual environment where additional information unrelated to the tasks was present. The results indicate that in addition to incidental learning taking place in virtual environments, learning style and digital literacy seem to predict incidental learning in some instances. The results also suggest that information display, in this case visual salience, plays a role in incidental learning as the participants performed better on recalling information that was made more salient.

These views essentialize DL on the bases of 'expert knowledge' and 'best practices' theses, fiercely compromising the context-driven idea of user knowledge derived from improvisation and intuition. By examining a group of Indian senior citizens, the study argues that creative appropriations of the Internet and computer enabled technology (ICET) demystify the standard view of DL and reconceptualize the relationship between 'end' and 'means' of technology as relative rather than categorical. To this end, the study situates techne, defined as creative skills residing within users, within the ritual mode of communication. In the context of India, the framework is embedded in the traditional Vedic ideals that exert tacit but powerful influences on the appropriation patterns of Indian senior citizens. Using mixed method research (MMR) to examine the ICET appropriation by senior citizens, the study shows that not just the social secular context influences how we use technology, but the metaphysical traditions inherent within a cultural framework can also impact and motivate users' response to technology. Therefore, ICET can be a powerful site where the contemporary and the tradition converge. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The growing prominence of the Internet, and other digital environments, as educational tools requires research regarding learners' digital literacy. We argue that two critical aspects of digital literacy are the ability to effectively plan and monitor the efficacy of strategies used to search and manage the wealth of information available online, and the knowledge to appropriately vet and integrate those information sources. Therefore, digital literacy requires effective self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, and availing epistemic cognition (EC). Although numerous researchers and scholars have examined the role of SRL in online learning (e.g., Efklides, 2011; Lee & Tsai, 2010; Williams & Hellman, 2004; Winters, Greene, & Costich, 2008), there is a need for additional empirical research on how SRL and EC interact, and relate to learning in digital environments. In this study, we used a powerful, but little-used data collection methodology, think-aloud protocol (TAP) analysis, to investigate the relations among SRL, EC, and learning gains with 20 college students who studied vitamins on the Internet. We also contributed to the literature by exploring alternative techniques for preparing, analyzing, and representing these data, accounting for the strengths and challenges of TAPs. We found that, on average, participants did increase their understanding as a result of learning with the Internet, and that a data-driven approach to understanding relations among SRL, EC, and learning yielded the most powerful representation of these phenomena. Our study has implications for future research on digital literacy using TAPs, as well as the relative contribution of SRL and EC, as aspects of digital literacy, to online learning. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The article outlines the framework of the digital literacy subject and underlines its associated objectives regarding adults' knowledge and competence in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The exploration draws upon the experiences and perceptions of eight adult ICT educators. The findings reveal that the educators tried to use flexible instructional practices that were adjusted to adult learners' needs and interests. Common effective instructional practices used were: ICT competence sessions, interdisciplinary and multi-literacy lessons, ICT-based projects, individual instruction sessions. Additionally, the article reveals the difficulties that adults faced in the course of developing ICT literacy skills. The paper ends with implications for the design of adult digital literacy courses in lifelong learning programmes, and for the preparation and development of the ICT educators in the years to come. © 2014, IGI Global.

In this, his most recent book, Rushkoff argues that in today's digital world all of us are adversely experiencing the effects of technology's capacity to make everything happen faster and to connect more of us to more information on a daily basis than ever before in the history of humankind. He contends that we have been thrust into an endless state of anxiety due to living in an eternal present (the now in Present Shock's subtitle). In addressing this assumption, the commentary focuses on three of Rushkoff's key ideas that pinpoint how present shock purportedly manifests itself in contemporary literacy practices: that is, through the collapse of traditional narratives, the perceived need to be in more than one place at the same time, and the tendency to engage in forced or imaginary connections. © 2015 International Literacy Association.},

This article is centred on the question of how we might rethink an example of digital practice based on a Foucauldian understanding of discourse and a rhizomatic understanding of digital practice through the actor network theory. The article puts forth several theoretical arguments to examine data illustrating recurring situations from an ethnographically inspired fieldwork in Norwegian kindergartens. Acknowledging how material agency destabilises human knowledge, the final section of the paper presents the Deleuzian concept of ‘event’ to examine some elements that evoke forces and actions in the network. The article argues that the potential of these forces can both open up pedagogy in relation to digital practices and challenge notions of agency when non-humans are understood as actors. © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to argue that the process of making an original game develops digital literacy skills and provides an authentic learning experience as students create, publish and deploy interactive games. Teaching students to create computer games has become common in both K-12 and tertiary education to introducing programming concepts, increase student engagement and recruit majors and minors in technology fields. This study describes a project where first-year college students in an introductory technology concepts course use a visual game creation tool to develop original games to play on their computers and mobile devices. Design/methodology/approach – The author created a game development exercise which was implemented in three different sections of an introductory technology course. Students who participated were surveyed about their experiences. In addition, the author considers information technology (IT) skills and aspects of authentic learning which are achieved through this assignment. Findings – Initial findings suggest that students found the gaming assignment offers an opportunity for students with no prior programming skills to create software within a controlled and supportive environment. It allows them to demonstrate their understanding of coding principles, including identifying objects and interactions, and that creating software requires a developer to specify exact instructions for the computer to follow. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited to results from one semester and a small number of students participating. In addition, student frustration with the complicated process of publishing games online may have influenced student attitudes toward the assignment. Practical implications – Challenges of implementing this study on a larger scale are discussed. Social implications – Creating games encourages collaborative learning through trial and error, and students who share their games with friends to play on their devices achieve a sense of pride. Originality/value – While most studies of game development emphasize the programming skills that are developed through creating computer games, this paper looks at a larger scope of digital literacy and IT skills achieved, as well as opportunities to perform tasks often completed by IT professionals. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The students were assessed in their own schools and the sample was divided into two groups: experimental group (N = 190) and control group (N = 174). The assessment was carried out in three sessions: pre-intervention, post-intervention and six-month follow-up. The programme was composed of three sessions aimed at improving digital literacy, as a way of developing a safe and responsible use of the internet. The results obtained after the intervention showed statistically significant differences in the comparison between the two groups. Specifically, the experimental group reached a significantly higher degree of digital literacy (conceptual, procedural and attitudinal) than the control group after passing through the programme. © 2017 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.},

Especially, critical literacy, a sub factor of digital literacy, has positive influence on the sub factors of self-regulated learning skill, including cognitive regulation, metacognition regulation, and behavior management. Although social literacy influenced behavior management, it turned out functional literacy did not have a significant impact on the sub factors of self-regulated learning abilities.

The literacy context is discussed in the context of the Educational Technology course which is delivered in teacher education. The aim of this course for preservice preprimary and primary classroom teachers is to develop student teachers' digital literacy and prepare them for the efficient integration of ICT into their teaching. This will in turn influence learners' digital literacy and competence for active engagement in the emerging culture of participation. The paper discusses web-based teaching methodology with a focus on instructional design, learning resources and high-order learning outcomes. The affordance of mobile technology fosters ubiquitous learning which has been integrated into the teacher education curriculum. The notion of tools in learning and literacies is discussed in the context of the transition from traditional written culture to digital culture. In integrating mobile learning, three important dimensions converge, underlining the development of digital literacy: the technology dimension of wireless mobile providing instant access, the social dimension and the learning behaviours dimension. A survey was conducted to examine undergraduate student-teachers' attitudes on the application of ubiquitous education and the development of digital literacy through the integration of mobile learning. The results indicate that student-teachers have developed competences in a variety of mobile learning and teaching activities They believe that mobile technology increases connection between learner and teacher but are neutral about the integration of children's social practices from their free time to school environment. © 2016 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive survey was adopted for the study, and the population consists of registered students that use the mobile telephone network (MTN) digital library, out of which 10 per cent of the population (281) was sampled for the study. A structured questionnaire was the instrument for data collection. The questionnaire was randomly administered on the respondents who come to use the MTN digital library with particular attention to the different levels of the students. The questionnaire distribution lasted for a week; 281 copies of questionnaire were distributed, out which 184 (65 per cent) responded. Findings: The study showed that some of the students possess digital literacy skills; they use these digital literacy skills daily. Majority of the respondents indicated that digital literacy has affected their academic performance to a high extent. The major challenges of acquiring digital literacy skills include electricity failure, low internet bandwidth, ICT facilities, lack of development of digital literacy programme and standard. Practical implications: Implication of this study is that the establishment by MTN has enhanced the development of digital literacy in UNN as many students utilize these facilities. Originality/value: Librarians and library staff should be adequately equipped with digital literacy skills and competencies to empower them to train and educate users, as information and communication technology (ICT) is a major tool for teaching, learning and research. To achieve this goal, there is a need to engage in public private partnership collaboration to sponsor the provision of these ICT facilities in our institutions of higher learning to enhance literacy learning for national development. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

While individuals use these tools in the hope that their training will improve their performance, this relationship is not a given. This paper proposes that an individual's level of digital literacy affects her performance through its impact on her performance and effort expectations. To explain the influence of digital literacy on the intention of individuals to continue using e-learning and their performance, we integrate the concept of digital literacy with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and test our model using survey data from New Zealand accountants working in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results indicate that these relationships were significant: digital literacy on users' performance and effort expectations, performance expectations on users' intentions to continue using Web 2.0 tools, and continuance intention on performance. These findings suggest that individual digital literacy facilitates the use of e-learning, and should be considered when examining the impact of the latter on performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {It is generally agreed that learners need to acquire digital literacy in order to act as competent citizens, employees and entrepreneurs in a digitalised environment. It is also generally agreed that digital literacy is the responsibility of educational systems that are themselves increasingly digitalised. Studies show that while students' digital production is a powerful driver for learning, a lack of digital literacy among teachers and students is an equally powerful barrier. There is no shared conception, however, of the meaning of digital literacy that may mean both bildung (general education) and a wide range of specific skills and competences: from basic computer skills, to source criticism and multimodal analysis, to social norms in online environments. Therefore, learning designs that are aimed at learners' acquisition of digital literacy, including related learning objectives, appear to be what Feltovich and colleagues call ill-structured (1996). In this paper, we present approaches that are embedded into everyday school practise and combine the acquisition of digital literacy as both bildung and a set of specific competencies. Accordingly, digital literacy need not necessarily be a course on the curriculum. These approaches rest on findings stemming from a large ongoing project within Danish primary and lower secondary schools, in which students worked with digital production of subjects and cross-disciplinary learning objects that were aimed at other students. These learning designs appeared to produce arenas in which students challenged and developed their digital literacy. The empirical data were produced through a mixed-methods approach whereby action research-one of the mixed methods-was combined with a series of interventions that supported iterative improvements to (and changes in) the learning designs and practise throughout the project's life cycle. The findings thus far are that digital production facilitates students' learning processes and qualifies their learning results in both digital and subject matter literacy when executed within a teacher-designed framework that empowers student agency. At present, the project's findings and practises are being implemented in the participating schools and at teacher educations. Because the findings are published elsewhere (together with a presentation of our learning design theory and research methodology), this paper emphasises the theoretical side of the suggested approaches based on Allan Martin's conceptual model of digital literacy, which we expand with Manuel Castells' self-programmable individual and Margaret Boden's concept of creativity. To conclude, we point to areas of interest for future development and research in the field.},

	abstract = {Blended learning has propelled into mainstream education in recent years with the help of digital technology. Commonly available digital devices and the Internet have made access to learning resources such as learning management systems, online libraries, digital media, etc. convenient and flexible for both lecturers and students. Beyond the physical classroom walls, learning can still continue at another place and time. However, although today’s students generally face no difficulties in using technology for everyday social and entertainment activities, it would be constructive to understand if the students can make effective use of technology for learning as well. It has been posited that to make effective use of technology for learning, one needs to have a certain level of digital literacy. Digital literacy for learning is more than just knowing how to operate the technology, but also having the right information management and critical thinking skills, as well as proper online behaviours. This study aims to answer the question: Do students require digital literacy to be effective in learning in a blended learning environment? To answer this question, this study examined the relationships between effective learning and four digital literacy constructs; i.e. underpinnings, background knowledge, central competencies, and attitudes and perspectives. Responses were first collected from the students who were taking courses in a blended learning environment at a local university and then analysed using partial least squares. Analyses show that the four digital literacy constructs could be reduced to three, and the three digital literacy constructs each had a statistically significant relationship with the effective learning construct. This study provides evidence that digital literacy is a prerequisite for students to be effective in learning in a blended learning environment. © ACPIL.},

Research in the field of game design and development suggests that open-ended design-based curricula, aligned with constructionist learning appoach that involves the "hard" skills of programming. In an investigation on game construction in middle school with a high demographic representation of Latinas/os, findings from ongoing observations, interviews, survey response and student game artifacts offer case study evidence of important motivating and deep-cognitive learning. Student interviews provide the student's perspective on game construction and its importance. Principal component analysis of the indicators of creative thinking, collaborative, and problem solving constructs, in a student survey, shed light on students' perceptions of game construction.

	abstract = {This investigation has a quantitative approach and has as principal aim identify the relationship between the Basic Education teachers' digital competencies and the educational use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). With this intention survey was applied to a group of 127 teachers of 6th degree of primary and 5th degree of secondary in 40 schools of nine districts of Lima. From the obtained information, three groups of competencies were identified: basic technological, pedagogic and complex technological, being major the presence of the first ones, followed by the pedagogic competencies and finally, the complex technological competencies. Likewise, there have been identified two types of technological use in the classrooms: personnelprofessional and with the student in the class, being confirmed that in personnel-professional level, the resources most used by the professorship are the processor of texts and Internet, and the use with the students is centred on the organization of the work in the classroom and with fewer frequency on interaction with pupils. Also low correlations exist between the digital competencies of teachers and the frequency of educational use of the technologies in the classrooms, nevertheless there is a major correlation with the complex technological competencies. © FORCE.},

	abstract = {The competence-based pedagogical model is having a significant influence on the debate about aligning higher education to labour market requirements. For that reason, each discipline needs to continuously monitor job prospects and adjust the university’s competence curricula accordingly. In this context, the purpose of this research is to analyse the existence of a possible gap between market requirements and education in relation to students’ digital competence level, and possible mismatches by sex and field of knowledge. To verify the correct match between the market and the development of digital competencies, a twophase research was conducted. In the first phase, the content of job offers was analysed, as methodology to determine the digital competences needed to perform a job. In the second phase, a survey was carried out among undergraduate students and their potential employers to evaluate their digital competence level. Employers were asked to evaluate the perceived level of digital competences that graduate students have (or, “what level of digital competence have graduate acquired at the university?”). In the case of students the questionnaire was self-evaluative (or, “what level of digital competence do you think you have acquired at the university”). The results of the study show some differences or gaps amongst university students in the use and digital competence level by both sex and field of study. Additionally, this study shows differences between the competence level perceived by the students and the level perceived by the labour market, which represents a clear mismatch between education and labour market. © 2015, Ministry Education and Science.

	abstract = {E-learning has transitioned from mere retrieval of information to active participation of students who voluntarily engage in the learning process. As Riedel (2009) reported, Web 2.0 is about putting the power to learn and create in the hands of the students. Before the advent of Web 2.0, e-learning was primarily used to complement traditional pedagogical modes with an online component, whereas web 2.0 technology introduced new modes of learning, enabling greater reflection and discussion among learners as they construct knowledge online (Lau, 2012). Therefore at this stage, the role of digital literacy in e-learning is even more relevant. Digital literacy which refers to the effective and efficient use of web 2.0 technology to access and use the digital information needed for a variety of online tasks (Coiro, Knoble, Lankshear & Leu, 2008) should not be regarded as a separate set of skills, but instead embedded within and across e-learning activities and tasks. Although today's students have grown up around technology devices and most probably use these devices on a daily basis, they may not have necessarily have the digital literacy to appropriately use web 2.0 technology for constructivist e-learning activities and tasks. For this research, questionnaires were distributed among students in several universities across Malaysia to identify the digital literacy competencies of students for application in e-learning. Thus, this paper reports the findings of the study which aims to answer the following questions: (1) What are students' perceptions regarding their digital literacy competency? (2) How does digital literacy affect their e-learning with 2.0 technologies? The results revealed that even though students have high confidence in using Web 2.0 technology, they still lacked the digital literacy competencies needed to successfully accomplish e-learning tasks and activities.},

One hundred and fifty-five education undergraduate students completed a series of tasks in a virtual environment where additional information unrelated to the tasks was present. The results indicate that in addition to incidental learning taking place in virtual environments, learning style and digital literacy seem to predict incidental learning in some instances. The results also suggest that information display, in this case visual salience, plays a role in incidental learning as the participants performed better on recalling information that was made more salient. © 2016, IGI Global.

The study takes three schools as investigative stage, using the survey as a data collection instrument, identifying patterns of behavior regarding: general knowledge of them, access to computer equipment and internet, and characterization of their use. Other aspects of analysis are the identification of the educational level of parents and access to technology resources available for academic and non-academic purposes in various application areas (home, school and social environment). The proposal concludes, that it is through the recollection of alternatives suggested by the teachers themselves to incorporate ICT for teaching purposes in a systematic and planned fashion, whose greatest reflection manifests in better digital literacy indicators.},

The results of the piloting were immediately used for improving the quality of the curriculum and after that all learning and teaching resources were published online for free. Learning resources have found their place in the proposal for the new national curriculum for the cross-curricular subject called Use of ICT as well as in the curriculum for the school subject of Informatics in all primary and secondary schools in Croatia. © 2016 Medijske Studije.

	abstract = {Purpose: Short videos, also known as micro-videos, have emerged as a platform for sharing ideas, experiences and life events via online social networks. This paper aims to share preliminary results of a study, involving students from two universities who created six-second videos using the Vine mobile app to explain or illustrate technological concepts. Design/methodology/approach: Students were assigned the task of creating a Vine video to demonstrate their understanding of an assigned technological concept. A survey, performed after creating their micro-videos, asked students about the technology tools they use that allow them to be creative, their current personal digital literacy skills and the extent to which they are able to express a complex concept in a simple way. The study categorizes the students’ micro-videos to determine which formats might be most effective in demonstrating technology learning. Findings: An analysis of their videos shows that the six-second constraint often inspires creativity and critical thinking, as students need to carefully consider the message they wish to convey, and how they can do so effectively in a compelling micro-video. The creation of such videos provides an effective way to demonstrate student learning and digital literacy skills. Research limitations/implications: The study presents preliminary results gathered during one semester, with 68 videos created by 75 students. Practical implications: Micro-video platforms are popular among today’s students, whose increased use of social media, dependence on mobile devices and desire for constant connectivity enable new outlets for creativity and communication. This study examines the introduction of a micro-video platform, which many students already use in their personal lives, in an educational context to develop their technology and digital literacy skills. Social implications: Students learn to use an emerging social media platform as a vehicle to inspire creativity and learning. Originality/value: This study explores and shares preliminary results related to the use of micro-videos for demonstrating technology learning and developing digital literacy skills in the information technology classroom. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of blogs on teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) to primary students. The study also explores educators' perceptions of social media tools and digital literacy in school environments. Design/methodology/approach - A three-step approach was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. First, the blogs of 23 fifth-grade students in an EFL class in Kuwait was analysed for one semester along with student perceptions and teacher observations. Second, a survey was distributed to the students at the end of the semester, and finally, four focus groups were conducted regarding educators' perceptions on the use of social media, their skills and needs and problems encountered. Findings - The findings showed that by the end of the semester, students were writing lengthy sentences, had fewer spelling and grammatical mistakes, were more motivated and independent and displayed a more positive attitude towards learning EFL. In addition, educators are enthusiastic about using Web technologies in their teaching practices but have several concerns such as digital literacy competencies, technology-use behaviour and lack of accessibility to digital content. Research limitations/implications - The number of questions on the student survey could be reduced. Also, it would be preferable in future studies to require all students to blog at least twice a week which could provide a broader representation of their writing abilities. Originality/value - Little research has been reported in the literature on the use of blogs in teaching EFL to primary school students. Most literature focuses on teaching EFL to university students. By using a mixed-methodology approach, this study also highlights the needs of educators and students in technology learning environments and makes a good contribution towards offering pragmatic solutions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Within the framework of an action-research methodology, a questionnaire was applied to 106 adults, aged between 26 and 92 years, resident in Portugal. From the data analysis, it was possible to establish 13 categories of needs within the scope of digital literacy of adults, including a set of references stating their desire to handle their bureaucratic issues via the Internet. These results constitute the basis for the proposal of a set of activities with digital technologies, geared towards promoting digital citizenship, around six broad learning areas: 1) information; 2) communication; 3) production; 4) leisure; 5) daily tasks; and 6) and digital identity security - the latter, considered to have a cross-cutting nature and therefore should be considered integrated in one or several domains of learning. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Students of today are digital natives. They acquire their digital literacy autonomously and are adept at using various Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to enrich their daily leisure life. Although prior research has addressed such phenomenon and its relation to school learning, the focus was mostly on students' adoption of ICT tools to facilitate their learning. This study takes a further step by relating students' digital literacy to their school curriculum and using the pedagogy of negotiated learning to improve their learning autonomy. The proposed negotiated learning design is to scaffold students along the authenticity-generalizability continuum; from operation-oriented knowledge and experience of ICT tools to the theory and technique of tools development and operation. It is expected that, by relating the school learning to students' digital literacy, the way of students' autonomously acquiring their digital literacy outside school may help them develop autonomy in school learning. For validating the proposal, an experiment with 36 university students studying the engineering course of multimedia technology has been implemented and evaluated. The qualitative results showed that participants developed their autonomy to exercise their digital literacy to resolve the difficulties they faced during Web exploration and data collection for their school learning. The quantitative data also evidenced their improvement of learning autonomy. The findings and the way how the learning practice is designed and implemented should offer teachers a different perspective of connecting school learning with students' digital literacy acquired outside schools. Moreover, under the trend of youngsters' digital literacy development, the findings provide a positive perspective on students' digital literacy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In a society dominated by the flow of information and communicative processes-in which digitalization has led to techno-media convergence, the complete uniting of ICT novelties and traditional media-it is essential to use all the vast experience of basic principles, pedagogical theories and practice which this educational paradigm has offered during decades. The current techno-media society is not an altruistic system; the communicative processes continue to be dominated by economic, political and social elites whose main interest is to influence and control the population. In this context-conceiving education as the only way to achieve the full and democratic development of our society, for its growth in values and solidarity-an analysis of reality starting in school is essential by forming a citizenship conscious of the power and influence of the ICT and its true meaning in the world. An authentic digital literacy should include the correct understanding of the new techno-media languages, and cannot simply be reduced to a formation of a technical and instrumental kind. © 2015, European Journal of Science and Theology.

	abstract = {The accelerated development of Information and Communications Technology has had a profound impact on the education system, both online and offline. In a South East European country such as Serbia, new technologies shape information, communication, and collaboration dynamics while contributing to a persistent digital divide regarding the skills necessary to obtain, process, evaluate, and communicate information. In this article, we explore digital divides between students and teachers in higher education with a focus on tensions surrounding digital literacy and collaboration. We apply Weber’s theory of stratification to an empirical case study of the digital divide in higher education in Serbia. We draw upon international indicators, secondary statistical sources, and primary semi-structured interviews with students and teachers in higher education. Through this analysis, we illustrate how forms of stratification intervene when trying to integrate new technologies and technology-oriented practices into the classroom. We consider stratification in terms of the traditional digital divide of access as well as stratification along lines of status, politics, and motivations. We interpret educators’ reluctance to adopt new technology as a reaction to the technology’s capacity to challenge the educators’ legitimacy, expertise, and preferred teaching materials. Students compound this situation with both greater familiarity and yet less focus on source credibility. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Our text illustrates these topics on a wide range of examples from current media, visual and social landscape. We address the issues connected with digital media, topics related to usage of social networks, alternative and counter-culture practices, etc. We try to illustrate potentially problematic issues of digital environment on the side of media producers, such as copyright and authorship protection, sources of information, its gathering, etc. The aim of this chapter is to show how the things surrounding us have radically changed in the last two decades and why this issue of digital literacy is important for the ability to orientate oneself in everyday life and why it should become the integral part of (not only journalistic and media) education. © Matteo Stocchetti, 2014.

Watch the reality with other eyes, means also to build knowledge in a different way and, finally, to accept to live in this new environment whose main character is the integration of virtual dimension into real life. This is the reason why a part of the chapter is devoted to defining the new technological devices as social objects able to become subjects of social acts. The conclusion is that traditional forms of media education must upgrade to digital literacy. In doing so, it becomes possible to prepare youngsters to become citizens of this new social environment.

The discussion begins with an explanation of a Neo-Gramscian approach to critical literacy education, contextualising this perspective within different conceptions of schooling. This broad philosophical debate is then related to key perspectives that have informed the social turn in literacy studies. The discussion emphasises that a positive teaching intervention should link language instruction to social awareness and ideological critique. Finally, these theoretical assumptions are illustrated by a report of a classroom experience in which university students learning basic digital literacy concepts (hypertext and hypermodality) were assigned the task of designing sites to suit the interests of a local peripheral community. The findings illuminate some contradictions and possibilities for teachers who try to combine literacy teaching with more complex social analysis. © 2007 D. B. Braga.},

The questions posed by this research are concerned with what constitutes learning in these spaces; how valid this is perceived to be by the students and how they engage with materials in this space. A question also posed was how cognisant the students are of their learning in these spaces and how they perceive the efficacy of the materials to support and enhance their learning. The research uncovered how the students interacted with each other in these informal spaces and the role that YouTube video content plays in community formation and supporting informal peer learning. The nature of informal learning spaces being that their focus being not solely of education, but also of entertainment leads to a variation in quality, reliability and suitability of content.

The project is based on a case study, focused on the sequence of the first academic course of undergraduate studies that begins with the Welcome Course (initial course on computer graphics) and ends with Drawing II equivalent to the introductory course on descriptive geometry. With it we propose to use a reverse teaching strategy, where future architecture students begin by using ICT tools and 3D technologies, rather than traditional drawing. Given the interest that they arouse in them and the ease of digital literacy, the results of the students' training in graphics, visual education, space understanding, and their academic performance and satisfaction are much higher than the usual ones, besides being achieved in a shorter period of time. © 2012 by Unisinos.},

	abstract = {The development of individuals' digital skills has received much attention as a remedy for digital inequality. Although some researchers favor courses and guided learning for skills development, others propose learning by trial-and-error. Unfortunately, studies examining the value of the so-called "do-it-yourself approach" for the development of digital skills remain lacking. One difficulty lies in the vicious circle of lack of skill leading to infrequent Internet usage and vice versa, which limits the value of cross-sectional data for assessing the impact of this approach. We present longitudinal data on a random sample of Internet users in a Dutch city, which show that more frequent Internet use leads to more digital skills, but not the other way around. However, contrary to expectations about the potential of trial-and-error learning to reduce inequality, results also suggests that this approach is not always more beneficial to the "have-little" as compared to the "have-more." The only inequality-reducing effect of this approach is that that older users profit more from it than younger users do. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Digital literacy has become one of the key competences to ensure social cohesion, active citizenship and personal fulfilment. The objective of the project Digital Literacy 2.0 is therefore to develop and to implement an ICT-based approach to lifelong learning addressing especially disadvantaged groups and vulnerable social groups of people with special needs. Since educational disadvantage is closely linked to social exclusion and poverty, there is a need to empower the really "hard to reach" learning distant groups and to enable them to make use of ICT. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The project partners are piloting a two-step approach to attract learning distant groups by offering an attractive starting point to information and social bonding: staffs at non-formal learning places like libraries will be trained for the use of ICT in their daily work with hard-to-reach target groups; they will gain competences in how to motivate socially disadvantaged clients to learn with the help of ICT/social media; adults from learning distant groups will be attracted to the places of non-formal learning by the use of social media thus improving their motivation to learn and empowering them to participate in social life. Findings: The project builds on the experiences gained so far in teaching digital literacy: special target groups can be attracted to learning offers by topics relevant to their daily life and offers that do require only a small first commitment to learning. Besides DLit2.0 will establish a new approach of non-formal education with the help of ICT. Social media make it possible to provide learning offers tailored individually to the learners' needs and thus increase the learning effects. Taking also into account the new opportunities of online participation and user-generated content, the concept of teaching digital literacy will be developed further in the project's lifetime and beyond. Originality/value: The network develops an approach to improve the collaboration between the non-formal education sector and the social sector. Staff from both areas will obtain knowledge and skills how to better understand the mode of practice of the other sector as well as to identify synergies and efficient procedures and to improve their collaboration. Information society has the potential to make a difference to the lives of people who often feel marginalized or isolated because of their social and cultural situation - DLit2.0 want to spread this issue to maximize this potential. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In view of the problems and difficulties identified in a previously published case study of WCIL practice in a class of secondary 3 students (aged 14 to 15), another round of WCIL activity was carried out in the same class. A series of measures designed to help students deal with the identified problems and difficulties were adopted to enhance WCIL for developing students' DL. We explored the effectiveness of the implementation strategies through focus-group interview, weblog postings, and subject teacher interview. Initial findings indicated that these measures are effective in facilitating the implementation of WCIL. To sum up the measures adopted in this round of WCIL, a preliminary implementing strategy model is proposed. Althoughit is not sufficiently verified, and is still subject to revision and adjustment by future studies, it gives a visual and more manageable model for reference of teachers planning and implementing instructional activities of this kind. © Informing Science Institute.},

With fresh demand for new services and applications, it is becoming essential that wireless network architecture seamlessly interoperate with new and existing technologies, protocols and standards. This paper presents recent work on the use of hybrid wireless network infrastructures for delivering tele-education and e-learning applications to remote communities by combining a variety of satellite, terrestrial and wireless technologies, and provides the results from live scenarios carried out employing various methods of interoperability testing. The analysis of the results examines a number of different issues such as delay, jitter, packet loss, latency, throughput measurement, and bandwidth. By combining satellite and terrestrial (wireless) technologies, full coverage and high capacity can be achieved for true broadband services for delivering educational content. The interoperability among such diverse networks imposes a number of challenges regarding service provision and management. © 2013 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

Are you a student teacher trying to get to grips with these new digital technologies? Would you like to find ways to make use of them in your classroom? Digital technologies are an everyday part of life for students and this book explores the ways in which they can be used in schools. The authors provide insight into the research on digital technologies, stressing its relevance for schools, and suggest ways to develop new, more relevant pedagogies, particularly for social learning, literacy, and literate practices. With a practical focus, the examples and issues explored in this book will help you to analyze your own practice and to carry out your own small-scale research projects. Explaining the theoretical issues and demonstrating their practical implementation, this topical book will be an essential resource to new student teachers in undergraduate and PGCE courses, and those returning to graduate study. © SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009.},

	abstract = {In this paper social semiotics, and systemic functional linguistics in particular, are used in order to identify registers of digital literacy in the use of virtual learning environments. The framework of social semiotics provides means to systemize and discuss digital literacy as a linguistic and semiotic issue. The following research question was investigated in the paper: What different registers of digital literacy could be identified when students and teachers communicate and interact in a VLE? The research question was answered by, initially, an application of social semiotics to virtual learning environments, and its relation to the knowledge domains of everyday, specialized and reflexive digital literacy. This application was then further developed, using an analysis of a course specific use of a virtual learning environment in a case study. The study identified discrepancies between the digital literacies of teachers, designers and students. These discrepancies mean that a shared semiotic register was sometimes difficult to maintain. The conclusion is that the designers and teachers as co-designers of virtual learning environments need a better understanding of everyday digital literacy in order to design more sufficient learning environments. The paper shows that digital literacy must be considered as a situated practice, and that it concerns functional and communicative competencies rather than acquiring a set of technical skills. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The following levels of a series of documents and in-depth interviews were analysed: general policy, the institution, curricula and subject programmes. The specific results presented here concern the approach taken to digital competency in curricula of the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Santiago de Compostela. In new degrees, this approach may be considered as an indicator of the way in which universities are facing up to the challenge of training new professionals that knowledge economies need. The analysis reveals discrepancies in the attention paid to cross-curricular competencies that are representative of the demands of the knowledge society, and that little attention is paid to digital competency.},

Even in the most developed countries they are underused. Suggestion is made on the particular role that librarians can play to make a more effective use of ICTs in educational contexts, as librarians have already adopted these technologies as a common and effective tool while teachers are reluctant to use them. © 2005, Sage Publications.

The research was taken with a particular focus on online activities carried out by students within an academic context. From the data analysis it is suggested that there is some variation in students' online skills and these are not randomly distributed.

Some have welcomed the educational challenges of digital culture and emphasize its possibilities for individual emancipation and social transformation in the new media information age (Gee, 2003). From this perspective, the traditional cultural consumer before the digital revolution is perceived more or less as a “passive” recipient and reader of static and finished cultural products that promoted a formal type of end-oriented learning and literacy through books, paintings, or films with discrete themes, meanings, and ideologies. Interactive digital cultural objects such as websites, DVDs, or online gaming environments are welcomed as unique forms of literate representation where meaning is negotiated and constructed because users can manipulate, enter, explore, perform, or even partially create their own forms of literary and representational content (e.g. blogs, Wikis, YouTube, and Facebook). © 2010 Taylor and Francis.},

	abstract = {Substantial investment in e-Learning in global HE contexts has been accompanied by a rapid growth in digital communication technologies. As a result students now engage in a range of digital texts, both in and outside the curriculum, many of which (texting, online chat, web browsing, social networking) are far removed from the more conventional literacy demands of university study. The research project introduced in this paper contributes to our understanding of this changing environment in exploring the nature of literacies, learning and technologies and how these intersect in students' lives as learners. It also throws light on the blurring of the distinction between what is in and what is outside the curriculum and the implications of this for learning. Research in the field of e-Learning has generally taken the technologies as its starting point (Conole et al 2006) and has paid little attention to the part that literacy as social practice plays in the construction of knowledge in digital environments (Goodfellow & Lea, 2007). Drawing on previous research into academic literacies (Lea & Street 1998; Lea & Stierer 2000), this research takes a textual lens to the experience of learning of undergraduate students in a digital age. These students are often referred to as 'digital natives', spending time text messaging, chatting on-line, surfing the net and using social networking sites. Such activity has led to claims of a crisis in student literacy, including the suggestion that students are no longer able to engage effectively in traditional academic tasks such as essay writing. The use of the web is also blamed on an exorable rise in plagiarism. At the same time, e-Learning now plays a central role in the delivery of the curriculum; for example, students now access web-based course resources, participate in online discussion, download lecture notes and presentations, produce their own visual presentations and keep learning blogs. They also have to complete electronic records of progress and personal development plans. Applying in-depth, fine-grained ethnographic-style methods and drawing on research into literacy as social practice, this work in progress paper will provide evidence of students' actual engagement with digital literacies in an attempt to take a measured approach to some of the claims that are being made about 'digital natives'. Students in the study are selected from three very different UK HE institutions. The levels at which they are studying and their social background also vary widely, with some students taking foundation degrees and others honours degrees. This work in progress paper will address questions raised in the mini-track, 'educational technology and the digital divide', and specifically in terms of', why are students with equally high access using ICTs to such different extents and in such different ways?.},

In this paper, we present educational actions that we have carried out for improving K-12 children and educators' digital literacy with focus on ongoing work developments and results. We have achieved qualitative results, showing an enormous potential for stimulating individuals' motivation/will and development in places under social and economic disadvantage. The results have been reached through computer supported collaborative and interdisciplinary learning experiences; young children's cognitive and technical skills development for using Web-based Virtual Reality tools and techniques with autonomy; including basic and higher education collaborative work. We have observed an increase on individuals' engagement with technology, which has supported ones' sustainable knowledge based interactions and technical skills improvements in diverse contexts. Citizens' technical knowledge domain has brought about ones' awareness and cultural transformation related to use information and communication resources better as lifelong learning companion as well as approximating individuals from arts, culture, science and contemporary technology.},

	abstract = {Much like immigrants who leave the cultural comfort of their home societies and move to places with very different cultures and social practices, those who teach online leave the familiarity of the face-to-face classroom for the uncharted terrain of the online environment, whose constraints and affordances often lead to very different practices. The trans-classroom teacher who moves between the two environments, transferring ideas, strategies, and practices from one to the other, is a mental migrant. The transformations-of the teacherand of the course-that occur in these migrations and the two-way interactions between face-toface and online teaching are the focus of this study. As teachers adapt their courses for the online environment, they are forced to reexamine the course design, reconsider curriculum strategies, and make many decisions about what to take out and what to keep, what to add and what to substitute. The implication for faculty who would like to implement mobile learning in their online or traditional courses is that they can begin by making content and information available to students in formats easily accessible by mobile phone or laptop computer. This would be a logical first step, since a majority of students and faculty already use these tools in many of their daily activities. Other tools, such as video iPods and MP3 players, can be phased in gradually. The following ideas could be implemented immediately with little to no additional cost. Most basic cell phones today can send and receive text messages, voicemail, and Email. Email is a convenient way to communicate information to the learning community, so the instructor can begin by sending class-wide "broadcast" Emails that students can access via a variety of mobile devices. © 2011 IEEE.},

These expectations have been either largely ignored or have failed to be understood by universities, resulting in a mismatch between student expectations and their experiences. However, the teaching staff within universities may be ill-prepared to meet these demands, either due to being non-users or exhibiting the same or lower levels of digital fluency as their students. The mismatch between student expectations and the reality is highlighted by an empirical case study involving undergraduate students enrolled in pre-service education degrees at an Australian university. The study will present clear evidence that students' digital expectancy should be considered when planning and improving learning environments.},

To protect youth from such crimes, it is required to teach both the beneficial and negative points of the Internet services. There are a lot of discussions among teachers of elementary school about how to teach the use of the Internet and mobile phone. We conducted a research on pupils' understanding of the danger of service on the Internet in a moral class of an elementary school. In this paper, we report the details of our research. We have realized that children should learn the correct use of mobile phones and furthermore, they should become capable of expressing their opinions clearly and politely. Based on this research, we propose a new tool that will help pupils to learn about moral the way of using the Internet. © 2011 IADIS.},

	abstract = {This article sets out a framework for a critical digital literacy curriculum derived from the four resources, or reader roles, model of critical literacy developed by Luke and Freebody (1990). We suggest that specific problematics in academic engagement with and curriculum development for digital literacy have occurred through an overly technocratic and acritical framing and that this situation calls for a critical perspective, drawing on theories and pedagogies from critical literacy and media education. The article explores the consonance and dissonance between the forms, scope and requirements of traditional print/media and the current digital environment, emphasising the knowledge and operational dimensions that inform literacy in digital contexts. It offers a re-interpretation of the four resources framed as critical digital literacy (Decoding, Meaning Making, Using and Analysing) and elaborates the model further with a fifth resource (Persona). The article concludes by identifying implications for institutional practice. ©2013 J. Hinrichsen and A. Coombs.},

The mobile tools, virtual applications and traditional computers form “an information ecology, " as Nardi and O’Day (1999) call it, by which they mean a system of people, practices, values and technology in a certain environment. Such an “ecosystem” technology is integrated into a wide variety of existing practices and manners, and users and tools that complement each other. In the lives of young people, the Internet has a central and multi-faceted role: it is a way to gather information and it is a tool and channel for virtual collaboration and communication through new applications of social media. It is also a space for leisure time activities, such as virtual collaborative games. Moreover, the Internet is an extensive arena for publishing, sharing and commenting on various kinds of texts, pieces of art, music and videos. Buckingham (2007) and Bryant (2007) emphasized that in this new reality, the social affordances and practices are new and exciting, not the technology itself. These new applications are not only tools that replace some earlier analogue practices; they alter the basic foundations of our existing conceptions of own cultural basis and values, attitudes and activities. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

These challenges not only imply significant changes to teaching models, but also the incorporation of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In today's world, where the need for lifelong learning has been accepted and new technologies have taken on a significant role, higher education has no option but to reconsider its objectives in the light of growing societal demands and new sociocultural trends. The changes demanded for higher education are based on a social need to make it scientifically and economically beneficial. In this context, the incorporation of new formats like the one involving the concept of competency, for example, has taken a firm hold. On the basis of references contributed by the DeSeCo project, this article defines the concept of competency as a referential element for certain changes that are taking place in higher education. It takes an in-depth look into the idea of training in information competencies, the meaning of which is analysed in this article. These are considered to be an advance on IT competencies (instrumental), since they are linked to knowledge construction processes of greater complexity.},

	abstract = {In the globalized economies e-permeation has become a basic condition in our everyday lives. ICT can no longer be understood solely as artefacts and tools and computer-related literacy are no longer restricted to the ability to operate digital tools for specific purposes. The network society, and therefore also eLearning are characterized by fluidity and the key competence for social actors in this ever changing e-permeated environment is the ability to cope with change - or Castells' conceptualisation self-programming. Castells' theory has influenced international definitions of future key competencies. Both lifelong learning and digital literacy understood as bildung have emerged as central for the definitions of and standards for future key competencies. However, definitions and standards only tell us about the desired destination and outcome of digital competence building. They tell us nothing about how we may get there. In the educational system ICT and e-learning are becoming an everyday condition and the basic challenge for the educational system is twofold: 1) The actually making of digital literate and self-programming social actors - students and teachers; and 2) How to develop adequate designs for teaching and learning for that purpose. We need research that aims to describe the phenomenology of acquiring digital literacy and self-programming in order to be able to identify relevant learning objectives and scaffolding. Findings from such studies are expected to be relevant for eLearning scenarios as well as for ICT and designs for learning in general. This paper presents a case study that aimed to explore the phenomenological appearance of self-programming as agency and learning among postgraduate students who participated in a specially designed eLearning workshop in the autumn 2009. The findings relate to both the individual and collaborative barriers and proactive strategies that come into play among the students. Drawing on the findings, it is argued that the presented workshop design contributes to the networked society's design for ICT, teaching and learning, as the design - at least for this small group of students - have proved to support the development of digital self-programming as a sustainable competence. In the autumn 2010 the study will be expanded to a larger group of students. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.},

	abstract = {Globalization and digitization have reshaped the communication landscape, affecting how and with whom we communicate, and deeply altering the terrain of language and literacy education. As children in urban contexts become socialized into communities of increasing cultural and communicational connectivity, complexity, and convergence (Jenkins, 2004), and funding for specialist second language (L2) support declines, classrooms have become linguistically heterogeneous spaces where every teacher is a teacher of L2 learners. This article has two purposes: The first is to give an overview of the concept of multimodal literacies, which utilize diverse media to represent visual, audio, gestural, spatial, and tactile dimensions of communication in addition to traditional written and oral forms (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009a). Since the New London Group's manifesto on multiliteracies in 1996, which merged language and literacy education agendas in L2 teaching, language arts, media literacy, and cultural studies, new basics have developed that apply to all classrooms and all learners. Second, this article reviews and reports on innovative pedagogical approaches to multimodal literacies involving L2 learners. These are grounded theoretically (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009a, 2009b; Kress, 2003, 2010; New London Group, 1996) and epistemologically (de Castell & Jenson, 2003; Gee, 2009, 2010; Kellner, 2004; Lankshear & Knobel, 2003, 2006). © Cambridge University Press, 2011.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the findings of a project "Digital Futures in Teacher Education" (DeFT) undertaken as part of the third phase of the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) UK Open Educational Resources (OER) programme. It builds on previous work (Gruszczynska and Pountney, 2012, 2013) that has addressed attempts to embed OER practice within the teacher education sector, and which has informed practice in teaching and learning in the school system involving digital literacy (Burnett and Merchant, 2011; Davies and Merchant, 2009). A framework for digital literacy is outlined, drawing heavily on socio-cultural models of digital practice (Merchant, 2011), that has the potential to re-imagine teachers and teaching, as well as learners and learning and which, at the same time, address the 'why' as well as the 'how' of digital literacy. This framework takes into account current debates (primarily within the UK but of relevance to European perspectives) focusing on issues of ICT, digital literacy and media literacy in the curriculum, which reflect a tension between digital literacy as a set of skills and competencies on the one hand and understandings that arise from socio-cultural and communicative practices on the other. Current understandings of digital literacy in the context of teacher education and OERs are explored and the potential for digital literac(ies) for openness is examined. This draws on data collected in the context of the DeFT project and includes meanings and perspectives on digital literacies as expressed by project participants. The effectiveness of a methodology that prizes reflexivity and participation is examined including a range of voices, including children's voices, in the meaning-making process and recommendations on the basis of the findings are made. In terms of a digital future for teacher education the paper highlights the need for practices, learning packages and tools to continue to evolve, in close cooperation with their potential users, and linked directly to classroom and schools as the site of this production. © ACPIL.},

	abstract = {Current educational policy in Mexico, as in many other parts of the world, leans heavily on teachers to use computers in their classrooms. This article explores under what conditions teachers are willing to learn about and use digital technology in their work. The authors' central premise is that incorporating technology into teaching is a complex process that includes redefining classroom relationships, re-interpreting the curriculum, and expanding the notion of academic literacy beyond written texts. Using a social practice framework, they present data from a collaborative experience between teachers and researchers who share knowledge and know-how about how to use computers for academic purposes and co-participate in the design of academic activities for their classrooms. This article shows that in order for teachers to use digital technology, they need to participate in viable transitional practices that allow them to foray into the new, take risks in a safe environment, and construct new approaches to what counts as academic work, classroom interaction, curriculum and evaluation.},

For policy makers the terms 'information society' and 'knowledge society' has been used to argue for implementing new technologies in education, and for improving learning. These views have been highly problematic, partly because they do not take into consideration how new technologies are used by young people, or how schools work as social practices. This article will focus on how we conceptualize a student perspective in schools related to the use of digital technologies. Combining an increased focus on digital literacy in school curricula with an increased focus on student participation challenges our conception of the school-aged learner. In discussing these issues I will draw on results from a number of school-based ICT projects that I have been involved in since 1998. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.},

The project goal was to identify how this new generation learns and uses Digital Technologies of Information and Communication (TDIC) in and out of school. It also sought to analyze how the domain of such technologies affects such generation's performance in school. The digital literacy is understood here as a set of skills to read, write and interact with other people, mediated by digital technology devices, whose acquisition by Generation Y occurs at home, still in infancy. A questionnaire about socio-economic and technological development was applied, and the participants (children and adolescents aged 9 to 14) were filmed when performing learning activities in the school computer lab in order to observe what were their technological skills. The results indicated that exposure to early technological equipment makes the acquisition of digital literacy by Generation Y as natural as learning to walk and talk and bring in positive impacts on its school learning. © 2011 by Unisinos.},

	abstract = {A shifting focus in education is resulting in more networked, technology-enhanced classrooms. Contemporary educators need to be aware of the skill sets students require to thrive in twenty-first century educational environments. This developmental and learner-centered approach, known as digital literacy, enables students to use technology to find, evaluate, organize, create, and communicate information. This chapter, therefore, proposes a theoretical framework for teaching digital literacy. The authors examine contemporary learning theories, including connectivism and chaos and complexity theories, in an effort to promote further discussion on the epistemological development of digital literacy. Taking into consideration advantages and barriers to promoting digital literacy in the classroom, the authors propose best practices for educators seeking to incorporate these competencies into their curricula. © 2014 by IGI Global.
