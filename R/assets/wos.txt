AB The COVID-19 pandemic initiated a fundamental change in learning and teaching in (higher-) education [HE]. On short notice, traditional teaching in HE suddenly had to be transformed into online teaching. This shift into the digital world posed a great challenge to in-service teachers at schools and universities, and pre-service teachers, as the acquisition of digital competences was no longer an option but a real necessity. The previously rather hidden or even neglected importance of teachers' digital competences for successful teaching and learning became manifest and clearly visible. In this work, we investigate necessary digital competences to ensure high quality teaching and learning in and beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based upon the European DigComp 2.1 (Carretero et al., 2017), DigCompEdu (Redecker, 2017) frameworks, the Austrian Digi.kompP framework (Virtuelle PH, 2021), and the recommendations given by German Education authorities (KMK 2017; KMK 2021; HRK 2022), we developed a curriculum consisting of 5 modules: 2 for individual digital media competence, and 3 for media didactic competence. For each module, competence-oriented learning goals and corresponding micro-learning contents were defined to meet the needs of teachers while considering their time constraints. Based on three online workshops, the curriculum and the corresponding learning goals were discussed with university teachers, pre-service teachers, and policymakers. The content of the curriculum was perceived as highly relevant for these target groups; however, some adaptations were required. From the university teachers' perspective, we got feedback that they were overwhelmed with the situation and urgently needed digital competences. Policymakers suggested that further education regarding digital competences needs to offer a systematic exchange of experiences with peers. From the perspective of in-service teachers, it was stated that teacher education should focus more on digital competences and tools. In this paper, we will present the result of the workshop series that informed the design process of the DIGIVID curriculum for teaching professionals.

AB We address the intersection between digital literacy and social education, particularly in socio-educational work with young people aimed at fostering their civic engagement. This challenge requires that social education professionals have holistic training in digital literacy, both in skills and critical digital knowledge. To find out their perceptions of their levels of digital literacy, we carried out a survey of the digital skills and knowledge of social education professionals (N= 144), looking at different sociodemographic variables. We proposed a bivariate analysis using correlations and a multivariate analysis with a multiple linear regression, taking critical digital knowledge as the dependent variable. The results show that, although sociodemographic variables have no effect on the level of critical digital knowledge, certain advanced technical and IT skills do have a significant influence. Finally, we discuss the possibilities for designing training focused on critical digital literacy, to improve performance working with young people.

AB Open Educational Resources (OER) are considered significant vectors of change due to their flexibility and transversality at all educational levels, also allowing customization based on learning styles. Four OER were designed in this study, according to the theory of Honey and Mumford (1986) (Active-Reflective-Theoretical-Pragmatic), for the digital information management competence. Through a training activity designed for research, the Learning Styles of university students (N=394) were identified with the CHAEA questionnaire (Alonso, 1992) and the OERs were assigned, one corresponding to their style and another to the contrary, at the end the students assessed the perceived interest and adequacy of the analyzed resources. Among the results, it is observed that either the assessment of interest and the adequacy (structure, time, instructions, and objective) of the scores were higher when the OER adapts to their style, except in the perception of the time used by the students of Active and Theoretical style. It is concluded that the adaptation to styles facilitates the personalization of learning because it increases its interest and improves assimilation by students. Being free access resources, it is possible for them to be reused, in accordance with e-Learning standards, especially for skills training.

DE learner-centred approaches; digital literacy; grammar
AB The rise of network use as a global phenomenon entices language teachers and learners to modify acquisition patterns towards an increasingly learner centered approach, with grammar learning partly taking place outside the classroom. In this paper we present a digital literacy project which investigates the potential of audio-visual learning and teaching (L&T) resources for the acquisition of grammatical knowledge and understanding in mother tongue and foreign language education. We focus on evaluation literacy, the cognitive and social skills that determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use evaluative information in ways that contribute to achieving learning goals (adapted from Rogers, Kelly & McCoy 2019). To achieve this aim, we first administered two questionnaires to 28 linguists and EFL teachers to establish and adapt existing evaluation criteria for the selection of grammar resources. Second, we applied these evaluation criteria to 345 existing online audiovisual grammar videos. This resulted in illustrations of evaluation literacy, as well as ready-to-use information on such resources for both learners and teachers. This information includes learner level for both native and non-native speakers, previous knowledge required to benefit from the resources (e.g. terminology), and accessibility. Third, we developed concrete examples of learning activities which blend online instruction with face-to-face communication. This approach is expected to help learners generalize through use rather than memorizing, and thereby transform them from passive listeners to active learners. The concrete examples of L&T will furthermore function as a framework for further discussion about digital pedagogy i.e. ways of approaching digital L&T tools from a critical pedagogical perspective.

AB The objective of this investigation is to understand how online distance education can contribute to promoting the development of digital skills, in particular, teaching digital skills. Contemporary society increasingly demands the use of digital technologies in the various areas of life, including in the teaching and learning process, even more evident in the pandemic context of COVID-19, which caused the suspension of face-to-face classes worldwide and imposed a new educational model, facilitated by digital technologies and based on online education methodologies, designated as emergency remote teaching. Among the many challenges, teachers had to adapt and reformulate their pedagogical practices and teaching methodologies in a virtual learning environment, often without having fundamental digital skills to promote quality learning. Through a narrative bibliographic review of an exploratory nature and qualitative methodology, studies, programs and models were identified that could be used as a reference to enable training propositions for the development of teaching digital skills, a key factor for pedagogical innovation.

DE digital competence; eCompetence; business informatics; curriculum
AB Being digitally competent in today's world requires not only access and use of ICT's, but also the appropriate knowledge, skills and attitudes towards them. The Digital Economy and Society Index Report 2018 (DESl), a composite index that summarises relevant indicators on Europe's digital performance and tracks the progress of EU Member States in digital competitiveness, reveals that 43% of the EU population has insufficient digital competence, whereas 17% has no digital competence at all. This not only implies their limited access to labour market, but also to benefits of digital transformation being undertaken extensively over the last years.
   According to data published by the Government, digital competences in Serbia are at an even lower level, with 51% of the population without any digital skills, and 14.8% with only partially skilled. Digital competences are essential for learning, work, and active participation in the society. They are among the vital skills for the 21st century, both for students and teachers. This was the motive for the reform of primary, secondary and higher education, which in higher education necessitates a competency-based approach to curriculum development in the domain of computer science, software engineering and business informatics.
   This paper presents the theoretical and methodological approach used in the development of bachelor and master Business Informatics study programmes at the University of Novi Sad, in the field of social science. The paper advances the theoretical perspectives of competency-based curriculum as steps taken toward innovative curriculum development efforts, with further focus on the developed theoretical framework used in the analysis and design of a competency-based curriculum for a business informatics study programme. This theoretical framework was drawn from several guides and case studies on competency-based program planning and curriculum development.
   The following competence-based frameworks for curriculum development were used in the innovation of the study programme: Digital competencies framework 2.0, Common European e-Competence framework 3.0 for ICT professionals in all industry sectors, and The European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning. The identified digital competencies served as a basis for establishing the theoretical framework for digital competencies to be used for determining the content for the courses in business informatics study programme that would meet the primary objective and be relevant in the light of the global trend of digital transformation. This paper concludes that a competency-based approach is effective, sustainable, and can be customized to address the digital skill gaps in the rapidly evolving information professions.

ID CRITICAL THINKING
AB This Research-to-Practice Full Paper discusses the use of the active learning approach to enhance the 21st century skills that are critical to developing new job opportunities for young engineers. The soft skills required in the Fourth Industrial Revolution make the traditional mode of logical-scientific thinking insufficient for the degree of innovation and disruption required in future jobs. In the field of higher engineering education, the situation was doubly challenging: Generation Z students' cognitive skills had to be improved in terms of digital literacy and cutting-edge technological tools had to be quickly incorporated. This work is a study on the effectiveness of the didactic approach of Active Learning in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) and the innovative ways of empowering students to develop digital literacy skills, among them: photo-visual ability, reproduction ability, branching ability, real-time critical thinking ability and, the most important of this study, socio-emotional ability. The opportunities and challenges that the study addressed were related to accessibility, inclusion, and self-paced learning. The research was carried out with a mixed experimental methodology in a sample of 352 engineering students, who were evaluated with different types of instruments to know the level of acquisition of soft skills related to digital literacy. To evaluate these skills, different assessing instruments were used for pre-tests and post-tests, including: vocabulary level, lateral thinking ability, fluency and originality; as well as story-articulation skill tests and modified VALUE rubrics from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U). The results obtained showed that the active learning approach promoted a better understanding of scientific concepts in engineering subjects, a greater ability to develop digital communication skills, and a greater awareness of creative thinking skill.

AB Accordingly to the Digital inclusion and skills 2014 document published by the European Commission, "47% of the EU population has insufficient digital skills, 23% has none at all", while "the biggest barriers to internet access at home in the EU are lack of need, insufficient skills and cost barriers". The Romanian educational system faces significant challenges for its continuous adaptations and alignment to the socio - economical needs and Digital Agenda for Europe. ICT is part of the common life and this should be significantly reflected in teachers' practice and students' learning. Based on secondary policy analysis, the present paper will present relevant findings for Romanian educational system. The key findings are based on the reviews of main researches produced at the European level. We are particularly interested in analysing and presenting relevant information regarding teachers and student activity (practice) as well as the institutional policies focused on integrating and exploiting the benefits of the technologies in formal teaching and learning. Comparisons of the data provided through comprehensive research for the Romanian educational system with others similar enables identification of quality grounded best practices that can be adapted and transposed into the education system and schools preoccupations and teachers activity. A particular attention is given to: a) report regarding ICT related continuous professional development of teachers from the perspective of TALIS 2013 and b) investigated specificity aspects regarding "the access, use and attitudes to technologies" in Romanian compulsory education, taking into account that improving the digital skills of teachers will ensure the possibility to use the potential of open and digital learning.

AB Background and Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate STEM teachers' digital literacy and technological integration skills. The willingness of teachers to implement new teaching methods is one of the most important determinants of educational success. Engagement, confidence, curiosity, and comprehension of integrated STEM disciplines will increase as a result of indirect STEM integration teaching experiences. Therefore, it is essential to conduct research on STEM teachers' digital literacy knowledge since it is believed that STEM education, which focuses primarily on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, involves complex science and engineering practices.Methodology: 150 teachers in STEM subjects from Kuala Terengganu were randomly selected to participate in the study using a simple and stratified random selection method. The data was collected using a questionnaire with five sections: respondent information, comprehension of digital tools, communication and collaboration, creation of digital content, security, problem-solving, and technology integration. Correlation and linear regression were used to analyse the data.Findings: Based on the findings, the level of digital literacy knowledge after COVID-19 was moderately high. In addition, there is a correlation between STEM teachers' digital literacy knowledge and their technology integration. It is estimated that STEM teachers' knowledge of digital literacy influenced approximately 47% to technology integration.Contributions: This study's findings may be beneficial for identifying the digital literacy challenges teachers in STEM fields confront post-Covid-19. Future research can therefore emphasize the identification and development of effective educational materials and programmes for STEM teachers, as well as the integration of technology into teaching and learning, in order to further develop the digital literacy of STEM teachers.

AB As advancement of the already successful Informatics Lab in 2016 a Teaching-Learning-Lab (TLL) was implemented with the main aim of supporting all teacher education departments of our university to teach and practice digital literacy and computational thinking as "fundamental skill for everyone" (Wing, 2006) in different ways. Our support is based on three pillars: equipment, know-how and research. Scientists, (future) teachers and students can use the rooms (creative, experimental and observation lab), the technical equipment and instructional technology for planning, designing, holding and/or observing and analyzing teaching units. We offer workshops for digital literacy and computational thinking in and for different subjects. Our main research focuses on the connection of computational thinking to other disciplines and its impact on problem solving and text comprehension. Furthermore, the Teaching-Learning-Lab offers research possibilities for scientists and students in different areas concerning teaching and learning. We enhance cooperation between schools and university and give support in finding research questions for master or PhD-theses in didactics, conducting teaching experiments. The paper describes challenges and opportunities of the Teaching-Learning-Lab in fostering the digital literacy competences and computational thinking of the target groups.

AB This article focuses on preschool teachers' collegial learning in relation to children's use of digital learning tools in preschool. The aim of the study was to investigate how preschool teachers understand, change, and improve learning situations when digital tools are used, under the supervision of a film educator, a preschool colleague, and a researcher. The results show how five dedicated teachers, without a special interest in digital tools, started using tablets in preschool as a learning tool to achieve the goals in the curriculum regarding communication. The experiment model used in the study is based on design-oriented theories. The design-based experiment provided an opportunity for in-depth reflection among the teachers and a meeting place for collegial learning processes, which can in turn lead to preschool development.

AB The objective of this research was to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with digital competence in teachers of a private educational institution. The methodological process consisted of an applied, non -experimental, cross-sectional, relational research. The sample size consisted of 82 teachers working in a private educational institution. The collection technique was the survey and the instrumental resource was the questionnaire. Among the results, the majority of teachers were between 41 and 55 years old (43.9 %), predominantly female (72.0 %), with a poor level of digital competence (51.2 %). It was shown that educational level is significantly associated with the pedagogical area dimension (p=0.002), and gender is significantly associated with the technical aspects dimension (p=0.035) and the school management dimension (p=0.035). On the contrary, it was shown that there are no sociodemographic factors associated with the dimension social, ethical and legal aspects (p>0.05) and with the dimension professional development (p>0.05).It was concluded that sex is the sociodemographic factor significantly associated with digital competence in teachers of a private educational institution in San Isidro, Lima, 2023.

AB Purpose: Distance education gained key importance in the field of education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A new era has begun for educators and students in higher education with the birth of education and training from a distance. In this study, the predictive power of academic staff's digital competence to gauge their distance education perception was investigated. Secondly, the predictive power of students' digital literacy to understand their online learning readiness was examined.
   Method: This study was conducted with a survey design, one of the quantitative research designs. The distance teaching dimension of this study was performed with 201 (F: 119; M: 82) academicians, and the distance learning dimension was carried out with 1612 (F: 1026; M: 580; Other: 6) students. For distance teaching, the predictive power of educators' digital competence was examined, and the predictive power of students' digital literacy was examined for the distance learning dimension of this study. Results: For the distance teaching part of this study, results showed a positive and significant relationship between the academic staff's digital competence and their perceptions of distance education. Furthermore, their digital competence significantly predicted their perceptions. For the distance learning part of this study, the results showed a positive, significant relationship between students' digital literacy and their online learning readiness, and their digital literacy significantly predicted the level of their online learning readiness. The results indicated that the digital skills of both the academic staff and students were a prerequisite for the effectiveness of distance learning and teaching. Implications for Research and Practice: As the results of this research indicate, digital skills have a significant impact on academicians' perceptions of distance education and on students' readiness for learning. In this regard, supporting the digital skills of both parties will increase their readiness for distance education and, ultimately, students will be able to benefit more from distance education.

AB Background: To provide high-quality education and remain innovative, thus contributing to sustainable development goals, educational institutions use digital tools and implement ICT in the teaching process. In addition to providing technical resources, it requires the appropriate education of teachers who should have the appropriate knowledge and skills to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by ICT.Objectives: The main objective of this article is to identify the current state of ICT knowledge and skills of university professors and high school teachers and to establish if there exists a relationship between their digital competencies and teaching experience. We strive to discover areas where digital competencies are already relatively high and ICT knowledge and skills gaps.Methods/Approach: Survey was conducted on a sample of university and secondary school professors who were asked to estimate their perceived level of knowledge and skills in various ICT domains.Results: The results of our research show that the total self-assessed level of competence is intermediate, with slightly higher values for ICT knowledge than for ICT skills. The results vary depending on the different subcategories of competencies and the years of respondents' teaching experience.Conclusions: Our research findings, which revealed variations and gaps in digital knowledge and skills among professors and teachers, may have significant policy implications for policymakers and educators committed to ensuring quality education.

   study; Q methodology; curriculum development; Switzerland
AB Prospective teachers need both general and subject-specific digital competencies. However, available competency frameworks usually address only non-subject-specific general digital competencies. Although the joint framework curriculum of the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland not only provides a comprehensive definition of expected digital student competencies, but also suggestions for linking them to and implementing them in subject lessons, there is still no integral planning and structuring for subject-specific teacher training in the canton of Thurgau. For a curricular design of the promotion of subject-specific digital competencies, three competency frameworks for the study programs Primary level, Secondary level 1, and Secondary level 2 at the Thurgau University of Education were derived in expert interviews based on the DiKoLAN framework (Digital Competencies for Teaching in Science Education). While there are significant overlaps, the original reference framework clearly needs to be adapted. Furthermore, there are important commonalities between the newly formed individual competency frameworks. The methodological approach has proven to be fruitful and is recommended to follow-up studies and studies with similar research questions for imitation.

AB Many Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are lagging behind the pace of the digital age; students go into Higher Education (HE) with varying levels of digital literacy acquired from previous experience and interests. These need to be understood, supported and aligned with the university offering in order to enhance the undergraduate learning and overall study experience.
   The students' learning and overall study experience contributes immensely to relevant HEI graduate attributes and employability including further career progression in early professional years. It is thus important for them to fit into and match up with expected level of digital literacy in the society and relevant professional field at transition from HE.
   However, HEIs have the challenging objective of identifying and understanding major points to integrate digital technologies in programmes, courses and career development activities offered during undergraduate journey. Also, challenges in the ability to balance the lecturer to student digital literacy level so that lecturer-student relationship is not lost but rather simultaneously enhanced.
   Graduate employers are similarly expectant in aligning recruitment attributes with the digital age. Therefore the responsibility lies on HEIs to enhance the learning and students' experience by incorporating the right level of digital literacy into higher education so that employers' expectations are not cut short.
   HEIs must be able to match digital literacy offerings with student's expectations and prior experience in order to enhance the undergraduate experience, also to enhance learning by incorporating the right level of digital literacy into pedagogic activities in order to output highly employable digital literate graduates.
   Through Digital Literacy in HE, a model for holistic curriculum development can be established, integrated and used to instil digital literacy at the heart of the student journey and enhance their overall learning experience. This paper discusses the holistic approach applied.

However, the consumption and the production of information is not always done in a responsible, professional and proper manner. Therefore, digital media skills became more important than ever and should be thought and learnt both in non-formal and informal way. Also, a special attention must be paid by schools and universities. When it comes on teaching and learning about digital media, our approach is media literacy focused on the resilience's perspective, underlying the perspective of content creation and dissemination of information, too. In this eco-system, we see media literacy as a combination of digital, social and cognitive skills where digital media literacy has as major role to help people to avoid becoming victims of "fake news" and disinformation.
   Thus, the main aim of this paper is two-fold:
   to investigate the students' awareness regarding the increasing phenomenon of so called "fake news". In this respect we applied an online questionnaire addressing their habits and practices when they have been encountered such doubtful content. As results, we present some recommendations and good practices on how to avoid such content, to critically read, interpret and curate the online content but also to re-edit, re-produce and re-purpose the content in a correct way, given due recognition to originators and
   to explore the digital media policies of the Romanian universities consortium, from where West University of Timisoara is taking part, regarding the usage and production of media content by students, teachers and administrative staff.
   Our finding suggests that more concentrated actions should be addressed. Therefore, this paper could be a starting point of further measures and recommendation for the near future.
   This article is based on the report the authors present at IC4E conference, 4-5 February 2018, Sydney.

AB This paper aims to examine how self-regulated learning strategies (SRLS) can foster the enhancement of digital literacy in digital learning to increase efficiencies in human capital for sustainable development in lifelong learning. Digital disruption in the education sector is unavoidable. The results of this study will be useful for educators and students to establish guidelines on how to utilize SRLS to enhance digital literacy competence and hence lifelong learning as developing human capital for the future workplace is crucial. Since research supports the fact that digital natives lack digital literacy, this paper look at how SRLS can foster digital literacy because it assists students to manage their learning independently online. Furthermore, there is a dearth of evidence on the effects of SRLS on digital literacy. How SRLS can elevate digital literacy is still rudimentary. To fulfill the purpose of the study, four hypotheses were formulated. A cross sectional survey of full-time undergraduates from IT or Multimedia programs to examine the relationships between the use of self-regulated learning strategies towards digital literacy in digital learning within from selected private universities with blended learning environments in the central region of Malaysia.A total of 563 respondents were analyzed via Structured Equation Modelling using Partial least Squares (PLS) to obtain the final results. The results of the hypotheses revealed three out of four hypotheses were supported corroborating that three domains of SRLS (metacognitive knowledge, resource management, and motivational beliefs) showed a significant positive influence on digital literacy.

ID COMPETENCE
AB Over the last few decades, digital literacy has been used repeatedly and have emerged as the core of the debate in educational matters. In the international guidelines, the concept of digital literacy has been connected to "what kinds of skills and knowing people should have in a knowledge society, what to teach young people and how to do so" [1].
   The objective of this study is to examine strategies for the development and improvement of digital literacy in primary education.
   To this day, the integration of the communication and information technologies in the curriculum is still lacking, except maybe for media education. This raises several matters relating to school development, digital content, teachers' professional competences, access to technologies and the concept of learning.
   There is a problem of a linguistic nature that concerns the use of "digital competence" instead of digital literacy, although terms have different backgrounds and meanings. Indeed, digital competence implicates the "confident, critical and responsible use of, and engagement with, digital technologies for learning, at work, and for participation in society" [2]; digital literacy refers to cognitive skills and competences from a functional perspective aided by practices and work. The conceptual development of literacy in connection with information and communication technologies dates back to the late 1970s and 1980s of the last century, thanks to New Literacy Studies. As expected, the concept of digital literacy was extended to take account of social influences and school demand in knowledge society.
   In the field of Educational Technology, constructivist and socio-cultural theories of teaching and learning have been significant in defining learning as a collaborative and socially situated process. Starting from these theories, different authors have begun to conceive technological artefacts as cognitive tools acts to favour more personalized and active forms of learning, in particular through the generation and verification of hypotheses with problem solving activities mediated by technology. As mentioned, the use of digital technologies cannot be casual or spontaneous for everyone, especially for children.
   For this reason, it is important to dwell on teaching strategies that can favour the development of digital literacy in student of primary education.
   This paper starts revising new theories of teaching and learning, in order to emphasize an active role of the students in improving their digital literacy and through exploratory research approach wants to identify teaching practices that can favour the development of digital literacy in primary school. University students of Single Cycle Degree in Primary Teacher education were involved in this study: data was obtained from semi-structured interview and interpreted by hermeneutic analysis of texts. Results show that future teachers of Primary Education intend to invest in the development of digital literacy in connection with information and communication technologies, favouring an active approach to learning. According to the findings of the study, these authors we will summarize and discuss the proposed considerations by the specialist literature to offer some food for thought for educational reflection about the use information and communication technologies in primary education.

AB Teacher training for the safe and responsible use of digital information and communication technologies has always been a special concern. Given the importance and emergence of the training demand, the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) emerge as an alternative to the needs of learning in an open way. Assuming that these courses have characteristics to contribute to training processes, this research aimed to present an alternative for the use of MOOCs in continuing teacher education plans for digital skills. The methodological approach of the study has a qualitative character, with an exploratory-descriptive bias and bibliographic research procedures. In the first stage of the research, we raised founding elements from a literature review. The related works found on approaches that involve the use of MOOCs in teacher training have provided us with evidence, albeit scarce, of the efficiency of these courses in teacher training processes. In the second stage, we carried out a survey on the MOOC platform of the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso do Sul in order to identify courses focused on digital skills. The results revealed that of the 15 available courses, 03 have the potential to integrate a track using the Padlet tool and contribute to the elaboration of teacher training plans.

AB Digital teaching competence is directly related to the knowledge, use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Its use in educational contexts and processes seeks to integrate technology and pedagogy. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the level of Digital Teaching Competencies (DTCs) possessed by basic education (BE) teachers in different Peruvian schools and their comparison by competency area, considering sociodemographic factors. The research responds to a quantitative methodological approach. A non-experimental design of a comparative descriptive type was used, and a non-probabilistic purposeful sampling was applied. A total of 3,142 BE teachers participated in the study, including the educational levels of preschool (0-5 years), primary school (6-11 years), and Secondary school (12-16 years), belonging to public institutions located in rural and urban areas of the province of Arequipa (Peru). The instrument developed in the European Framework of Digital Competence, DigCompEdu Check-In, was applied. This instrument aimed to measure teachers' level of competence in the digital domain. The main results show that a more significant number of teachers present an Integrator competence level (B1), followed by the Expert level (B2), and the Explorer level (A2). Furthermore, low percentages are observed in the most advanced leadership levels, Leader (C1) and Pioneer (C2), in the use of ICTs. The results obtained suggest implementing new strategies to improve DTCs. Based on critical conceptions, technology constitutes an essential tool for education in the twenty first century.

DE Competence; professional competence; teacher competence
AB The objective of the study was based on the analysis of digital competence, according to the perception of non-university higher education teachers, belonging to the Regional Directorate of Pasco, participants of a specialized diploma course in research methodology and pedagogical innovation developed online through the Zoom platform, by the Daniel Alcides Carrion Professional Extension Educational Corporation. The research was developed within the parameters of the quantitative approach with a non-experimental, correlational, comparative design, with a non-probabilistic and intentional sample of 117 teachers. Data collection was carried out by sending an online questionnaire through a group WhatsApp. The results of the research highlighted the difficulties identified in non-university higher education teachers regarding the development of their digital competencies; likewise, it is shown that there are no statistical differences in the development of digital competencies in terms of gender, as well as time of service. However, it is shown that there are statistical differences in terms of the educational institution of origin.

ID COMPETENCES
AB It is generally agreed that learners need to acquire digital literacy in order to act as competent citizens, employees and entrepreneurs in a digitalised environment. It is also generally agreed that digital literacy is the responsibility of educational systems that are themselves increasingly digitalised. Studies show that while students' digital production is a powerful driver for learning, a lack of digital literacy among teachers and students is an equally powerful barrier. There is no shared conception, however, of the meaning of digital literacy that may mean both bildung (general education) and a wide range of specific skills and competences: from basic computer skills, to source criticism and multimodal analysis, to social norms in online environments. Therefore, learning designs that are aimed at learners' acquisition of digital literacy, including related learning objectives, appear to be what Feltovich and colleagues call ill-structured (1996). In this paper, we present approaches that are embedded into everyday school practise and combine the acquisition of digital literacy as both bildung and a set of specific competencies. Accordingly, digital literacy need not necessarily be a course on the curriculum. These approaches rest on findings stemming from a large ongoing project within Danish primary and lower secondary schools, in which students worked with digital production of subjects and cross-disciplinary learning objects that were aimed at other students. These learning designs appeared to produce arenas in which students challenged and developed their digital literacy. The empirical data were produced through a mixed-methods approach whereby action research-one of the mixed methods-was combined with a series of interventions that supported iterative improvements to (and changes in) the learning designs and practise throughout the project's life cycle. The findings thus far are that digital production facilitates students' learning processes and qualifies their learning results in both digital and subject matter literacy when executed within a teacher-designed framework that empowers student agency. At present, the project's findings and practises are being implemented in the participating schools and at teacher educations. Because the findings are published elsewhere (together with a presentation of our learning design theory and research methodology), this paper emphasises the theoretical side of the suggested approaches based on Allan Martin's conceptual model of digital literacy, which we expand with Manuel Castells' self-programmable individual and Margaret Boden's concept of creativity. To conclude, we point to areas of interest for future development and research in the field.

AB Introduction: The advent of Information Society has induced substantial changes in the way we perceive our personal, social and work life. The ongoing changes that are observed in the frame of the globalised economical and technological environment, contribute in the development of a new social scene. The Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are creating a new environment in the field of education, work and communication, by developing new challenges and opportunities. Researches on the evaluation of inadequacies in digital skills in Europe have concluded that the demand for people that are qualified with some basic ICT skills will be increased. Currently, the field of education is assessed as critical for the development of digital skills.
   Methods: Greek data derived from the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 were used to evaluate whether availability of computers and access to the internet may be related with students' reading performance. In particular, 4969 Greek students (16 +/- 0.28 years, 49% boys) were participating in the PISA 2009 and were asked to answer a computer familiarity questionnaire focusing on the availability and use of information and communications technology (ICT). Questions were combined in six main categories that reflect the availability and use of equipment (i.e., PCs, printers, USB sticks etc) at home and at school and the frequency of using internet both for entertaining or educational purposes at home and at school. One way analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression models were used to answer the research hypothesis.
   Results: Students who were familiar with the use of ICTs had higher mean reading performance as compared to the overall mean (486 +/- 4.3 vs 483 +/- 4.3, p<0.0001). Results revealed that students who have access and use a PC at home had higher mean reading performance as compared to those who don't use a PC (495 +/- 3.7 vs. 465 +/- 7.3, p<0.0001). In addition, the higher mean reading performance was noticed for students that have PC access at their school, but they don't use it. Furthermore, students who use rarely their internet access (either for educational or entertaining purposes) seemed to have the mean higher reading performance, as compared to those with daily use. Results from multivariate, age and gender adjusted, logistic model revealed that students who use a PC at home have twice odds of mean reading performance above country's overall mean performance as compared to those who don't have a PC (OR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.90-2.18). The same trend was also observed for students who use a PC at school (OR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.51-1.73). On the contrary, the frequent use of internet either for educational or entertaining purposes has been positively related with mean reading performance below country's overall mean performance (OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.47-0.51; OR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.41-0.46, respectively). Conclusion: By the data analysis of the research, it is detected that ICT use by students in home and/or school, their familiarisation and development of digital skills seems to be correlated to their performance.

DE digital literacy; teacher education; learning organization; competence
   development
AB Swedish teacher education has been subject to criticism for not providing teachers-to-be with sufficient training in the pedagogical use of ICTs. In 2005, a nationwide initiative was launched by the Swedish Knowledge Foundation to improve this situation in teacher education. One of the projects, called LIKA (Learning, Information, Communication, Administration), brought together four institutions of higher education in Stockholm region to integrate ICTs in teacher education. This six-year project engaged approx. 600 teacher educators and 6 000 teacher students in 245 different activities. In this paper, we analyze the experiences from LIKA project that aimed at taking a novel approach to ICT implementation combining the latest technology with participatory and collaborative approaches to teaching and learning. The project applied a holistic model emphasizing at one hand the importance of regarding theoretical, pedagogical, and technical competences as equally relevant parts of digital literacy, and on the other hand, the importance of including all aspects of teaching profession into the system of competence development i. e. Learning, Information, Communication and Administration. In a follow-up survey we examined whether the central ideas from LIKA project still define the competence development and organizational learning activities at departments, which are involved in teacher education, and what kind of new developments have taken place since the end of the project period in 2013. The survey responses indicate that crucial issues for the integration of digital literacy remain the same over the years: how to create and maintain a learning organization in the academic environment of higher education, and how to preserve a functioning, up-to-date notion of digital literacy. Our respondents maintain that digital literacy has increasingly become a part of everyday practices in teacher education. However, the challenges of dispersed teacher education programs involving several departments and the strenuous working conditions of teacher educators make it hard to develop the notion of digital literacy and make ICTs an inspiring part of their pedagogic practice.

DE Digital literacy; mathematical literacy; revision of curriculum
AB In connection with the current discussed reform of curricular documents in the Czech Republic the perception of digital literacy and its implementation into the educational process is changed, into the teaching mathematics including. In addition to the requirement of the teachers' digital competencies, there is also a requirement to respond to the actual change the perception of the objectives of mathematical education especially in the relationship between building and developing both pupils' mathematical and digital literacy. The article describes the transformation of digital literacy perception, it identifies its planned anchorage during mathematical teaching and it presents the documents on which the reform is based. In the current curricular reform digital literacy should be one of the main objectives in teaching specialized subjects (in this case mathematics), which should be achieved through appropriately designed curriculum and adequate use of digital technologies. The main objective of teaching mathematics is decomposed to the development of mathematical literacy and digital literacy.

AB Digital literacy (DL) is a one of the competency recommended for educators to be embedded in the Kenyan Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) in preparation for learners for the 21st century skills. The Ministry of Education deployed devices to lower primary at a ratio of 1 to 1. The aim of the research was to determine the level and frequency of embedding the digital literacy abilities after the teachers and school leaders in a 3-day preparation and 8 weeks of implementation with virtual support through Communities of learning.
   The methodology was a self-administered survey which evaluated the seven abilities based on the level and frequency of implementation. The dot product of level and frequency were determined as a percentage. The analysis explored the average percentages and the relationship between level and frequency of implementation.
   The findings revealed that there was a correlation between the level and the frequency of implementation. All abilities where at developing stage on average. The mode and mean on levels and frequency were on average similar apart from few cases where it was above. All the abilities had a bell curve on implementation with access, integrate and evaluate skewed to the right.
   It can be concluded that despite the deployment of devices there is still very low implementation of DL and there is a significant relationship between the level and frequency of implementation. There is need to interrogate possible factors to low implementation beyond devices and educator preparation with virtual support.

AB The use of new technologies in teaching proves its efficiency provided that teachers receive proper training in this area. It is also necessary for the teacher to adapt the electronic resources available to the age of students and their learning needs. New computer skills in kindergarten are focused on issues related to teacher training (the ability to use the computer, the characteristics of the subject they teach, the age level of students), to the available material basis (the access to ICT equipment, the number of computers and other equipment, ICT equipment placement in special purpose spaces, reliability, Internet access, networking, diversity and quality of educational software), to their personality structure (positive attitude and open to the utility of new technologies, professional experience) but also to the institutional needs (supporting the school organization the teacher belongs to, both technically and in terms of educational or scientific, the dynamic culture of the educational organization characterized by disseminating of best practices). The premise behind the present study was the idea that the integration of ICT in preschool education is conditioned by three important elements: initial and continuous training of teachers, teachers' attitude towards ICT as well as the conditions or the actual context of the integration of ICT. Our study is an investigation conducted on a representative sample of preschool teachers and aims to highlight the ways in which they have formed and develop their digital skills, but also the ways in which these skills are put into practice in the course of instructive teaching activities with preschoolers.

AB PurposeThe significance of digital literacy in online social capital accumulation and surviving the contemporary society is widely recognised. Despite that the current generation is regarded as "digital natives", their levels and nature of digital literacy vary. To generate educational insights, this study investigates the type(s) of digital literacy which are mostly related to the online social capital accumulation, and how one's socio-economic background affects the connection between digital literacy and online social capital.Design/methodology/approachA total of 1,747 participants aged 13-30 were invited to take part in a quantitative study. Spearman's rank correlation analysis, hierarchical regression analysis and mediation analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between participants' demographic background, engagement in the online platforms, digital literacy and online social capital.FindingsThe results showed that the creative dimension of digital literacy was mostly significantly predictive of online social capital accumulation. Also, education significantly affected the relationship between the creative dimension of digital literacy and online social capital more than demographic background.Originality/valueResults suggest that education helps enhance digital literacy, offsetting the influence of socio-demographic background. The author examines the implications of how to implement training programmes in youth settings to enhance students' digital literacy and benefit those who are marginalised.

AB Education is currently facing a critical challenge: literacy of children for digital culture and digital citizenship. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is a socializing instance of childhood. The universal use that children make of ICT today broadens the context of interpersonal relationships. The aim of this study is to present the collected data from a sample of 3rd to 6th grades of Primary Education. The objective is defining their Internet and mobile phones usage patterns, and to analyze which cyberconvivencia related communicative processes are established. Internet usage patterns are very similar between both stages, although there are some differences on the activities that take place on the Internet. The data presented in this study shows the need of focussing action from earlier ages. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Crucial for organizations' business performance, 21st-century digital skills have gained prominence. The Covid-19 pandemic's impact on individuals, education, and higher education institutions led to a shift from traditional face-to-face to remote synchronous learning. Students experienced diverse information and communication technologies (ICTs), while instructors adapted course structures, engaged in e-learning, and revamped online curricula. This study examines factors affecting students' digital skills acquisition, including instructor involvement, e-course quality, e-learning system usability, and e-course interactivity. Additionally, we explore the relationship between increased educational ICT usage and improved digital skills. Drawing from a survey of 624 higher education students in Pristina, Kosovo, and employing variance-based PLS-SEM analysis using SmartPLS 3.0, we find that active professor engagement in e-learning significantly influences digital skills acquisition. Ease of use and e-course interactivity also wield substantial effects, while e-course quality indirectly affects digital skills. Enhanced educational ICT usage positively correlates with creative and innovative skills development, enabled by content creation and ICT integration. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the potential enhancement of digital skills acquisition among higher education students. The findings indicate that increasing students' gaining digital skills through e-learning is indeed achievable through instructor involvement, e-course quality, ease of use, and increased ICT utilization. This study's insights provide a foundation for educators, institutions, and policymakers to make informed decisions on designing effective e-learning environments and strategies that promote students' digital skills in a rapidly evolving educational landscape.

ID LEARNING-OBJECTIVES; EDUCATION; INFORMATICS
AB Studies have shown that national-level initiatives to equip medical students with relevant digital competencies carry many benefits. Yet, few countries have outlined such competencies for clinical practice in the core medical school curriculum. This paper identifies current training gaps at the national level in digital competencies needed by students in the formal curricula of all three medical schools in Singapore from the perspectives of clinical educators and institutional leaders. It bears implications for countries that intend to implement standardized learning objectives for training in these digital competencies. Findings were drawn from in-depth interviews with 19 clinical educators and leaders of local medical schools. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling. Data were interpreted using qualitative thematic analysis. Thirteen of the participants were clinical educators while 6 were deans or vice deans of education from one of the three medical schools in Singapore. While the schools have introduced some relevant courses, they are not standardized nationally. Moreover, the school's niche areas have not been leveraged upon for training in digital competencies. Participants across all schools acknowledged that more formal training is needed in digital health, data management, and applying the principles of digital technologies. Participants also noted that the healthcare needs of the population, patient safety, and safe procedures in the utilisation of digital healthcare technologies should be prioritized when determining the competencies needed by students. Additionally, participants highlighted the need for stronger collaboration among medical schools, and for a stronger link between current curriculum and clinical practice. The findings highlighted the need for better collaboration among medical schools in the sharing of educational resources and expertise. Furthermore, stronger collaborations with professional bodies and the healthcare system should be established to ensure that the goals and outcomes of medical education and the healthcare system are aligned.

AB Given the digitalization of modern society and the way a child acquires musical experiences, practitioners are expected to apply various media in everyday educational praxis. The theoretical framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is an approach that connects the knowledge of educators with Information and Communications Technology (ICT), concurrently developing technology-supported pedagogical knowledge and integration of technology into education. The paper aims to investigate educators' self-assessment of their digital competencies and their implementation in musical activities with preschool children. The respondents are full-time and part-time graduate students of the Early Childhood and Preschool Education study program from faculties of teacher education in Croatia. The obtained results indicate that 91,1 % of respondents didn't have any formal ICT education while 59,5 % didn't have any additional type of music education except during their studies. Nevertheless, the greatest knowledge participants have shown on the competencies for using digital tools (CFUDT) scale succeeded by a technological knowledge (TK) scale of the adapted TPACK-TCCMA survey, thus the respondents rated their digital and ICT competencies exceedingly high unlike music and pedagogical competencies. Considering the results obtained, it can be concluded that additional attention should be given to the development of digital, music, and pedagogical competencies during studies that will be applicable in both music and other areas of education.

AB This article arises from the proposal of a new approach regarding the inclusion of soft-digital skills training in higher education. The study carried out on several curricular units in different higher education courses in Portugal led us to reflect on a different educational model, which combines the development of soft skills in digital environments. Digitalization and the use of technologies since early ages in the educational process are raising interesting questions. This article intends to go deeper on the use of digital technologies, namely through the virtual environments imposed by higher education institutions as a form of study. The main question is how pedagogies and the use of technologies have a meeting point where it is possible to continue humanization in education through the utilization of virtual environments to support the teaching/learning process. The methodology used in this study has its support on questionnaires made to students of higher education in different areas of knowledge, such as medicine, nursing, engineering, management, arts and literature. The main conclusions of this study are the importance of creating and using digital platforms that not only support the study but also contemplate the use of a virtual reality where students can interact with others in the discussion and resolution of real life situations.

DE Competencies; M-learning; Elderly
AB M-learning is a field with many possibilities in education. There are initiatives to map actions that include mobile devices as inclusive practices in teaching, with the aim of contributing to the development of digital competencies. On the other hand, it is noticed that the elderly are increasingly seeking courses to learn how to handle mobile technologies. In this sense, it is necessary that the education also investigate possible actions that propitiate m-learning for the elderly, from the competencies necessary for this public to use the mobile devices. In the present study, the term competence is understood as a set of Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSA) that provide the subjects with subsidies to deal with problem situations. The aim of the research is to identify the digital competencies of the elderly for m-learning. The research was developed in a qualitative and quantitative approach of the case study type. The target audience for this project is elderly people aged 60 or over. The methodology used has 6 steps: Step 1 - Construction of the theoretical framework; Step 2 - Preliminary mapping of competencies in m-learning for the elderly; Step 3 - Pilot project: mapping competencies from the KSA; Step 4 - Building competencies for m-learning with the elderly; Step 5 - Construction of pedagogical strategies; Step 6 - Validation of pedagogical strategies for the development of competencies in m-learning with the elderly. The instruments used were: questionnaires, participant observation and interview. As a result, it was observed that it is important to consider not only knowledge, skills and attitudes in the use of mobile devices, but also their interests, expectations, difficulties, which are not only inherent in biophysiological and cognitive issues, but also related to affective and social rights.

AB Digital native students are a challenge for some teachers. In Romanian educational context, not all teachers allow students to use the technology freely and independently in order to handle learning tasks. This study aims to investigate the correlations between students' self-perceived digital competencies, relevant related attitudes and their level of self-direction in learning, alongside with their perception of how teachers relate to the use of technology for the educational process (teaching & learning). For this study, we used a cross-sectional design, with data collection in multiple sequences, from a non-randomized sample of 200 undergraduate students, distributed into 2 groups (technical and non-technical specializations), with no intended intervention. The methods used in collecting data were online survey (using questionnaires) and focus-group interviews. The results indicate that students' level of self-directed learning correlates with the frequency of using digital tools for learning. Furthermore, students that are prone to a high frequency and more complex usage of technology due to their specialization, are more likely to report a more favorable attitude towards digitalized learning than students majoring in social sciences. Also, the more self-directed the students are in their learning, the higher they score on their self-efficiency level. The results show that the higher the level of self-efficiency is, the better their level of self-perceived digital competencies is. We also observed that their level of self-perceived digital competencies could be associated with their self-efficiency level. Moreover, seems like a higher level of learning satisfaction appears in students whose teachers allow them to decide independently about the frequency and modality of technology usage in their learning.

SO JOURNAL OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

DT Article
AB Digital tools and spaces are becoming prevalent in schools across the world requiring the development of digital skillsets for student-teachers. Digital technology, in enabling education to extend beyond the space and time boundaries of the conventional classroom (Seifert et. al., 2015), brings the digital landscape into the classroom and firmly into the frame of reference for those preparing student- teachers to enter the profession. For Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes which foreground social justice, the digital (i.e., technology which is linked to the internet) goes far beyond a skillset or a discrete subject. Engaging with digital learning encompasses the 21st century context - both local and global - in which student-teachers and their future pupils are situated. Developing a critical pedagogic approach involves understanding the context in which one lives and enabling learners to challenge or change it (Freire, 1996). For those working in ITE a postdigital lens provides a means to understand the context in which they are situated. Critical pedagogy enables student-teachers to understand that context, and challenge the inequities which persist, preparing them not simply to navigate the digital landscape, but to engage with it critically. Reflecting on student-teacher learning this article explores the digital dimension, highlighting the importance of digital learning when engaging with critical pedagogy and social justice in ITE.

AB The research analyzes the importance and influence of digital skills as pedagogical predictors in the learning-to-learn process. These are skills that allow students to improve their skills in the use of information and communication technologies; in turn, they can promote learning as an individual event. Consequently, a case study is carried out, considering a group of 432 pedagogy students at the university level. A correlational design is proposed and the Digital Competence Questionnaire of Higher Education Students (DCQHES) is used; applying the AaA competence evaluation questionnaire, to collect the data. The results show that there is a low correlation (r=0.226) between the variables and the dimensions: creativity and innovation, critical thinking, problem solving, digital citizenship modeling and decision making; assets that benefit self-taught education. It is concluded that virtual skills show low promotion of techniques that favor self-teaching.

AB This article explores the Internet-use attitudes behaviors, and skills associated with digital literacy amongst students in higher education. A survey was administered using a sample of 148 first-year students and qualitative data was collected by means of 22 individual interviews and two focus groups. Elements of digital literacy such as confidence in sharing contents, privacy and protection, information literacy skills and ethicality/responsibility surrounding the access and use of digital information were analyzed from participants' online activities. The research was taken with a particular focus on online activities carried out by students within an academic context. From the data analysis it is suggested that there is some variation in students' online skills and these are not randomly distributed. These results are consistent with the idea that even among a highly wired group of young adults, the use of ICT does not necessarily mean 'meaningful use of ICT'.

AB Relationships between technological development and learning are described and the development of cultural tools and external memories are pointed out. The processes of how learning integrates with ICT are viewed from socio-cultural as well as constructionist theoretical perspectives. The concept of digital literacy is understood to be closely related to learning processes as social practices. Examples of how digital literacies can be introduced and performed in courses and educational programs within teacher education are given. Learning environments which can support development of digital literacies are presented with examples from Stockholm Institute of Education/Stockholm University.

DE Digital Literacy; Online Writing; The Education Community
AB Digital literacy is defined as the ability to understand and use information in a variety of formats coming from various resources presented through computers and the internet. Indonesia is one of the countries with the largest number of internet users in the world. In 2019, out of 268.2 million people, 150 million are connected to the internet (a 13% increase or goes up for around 17% from the previous year) and school children (aged 13-17 years) account for 15% of the total users or about 2.25 million people. The large number of school-aged Internet users leads to a study on the description of the users' ability to understand and use information in accessing information through digital media. A survey of digital literacy was conducted to 140 members of an education community consisting of 48 teachers and 92 students from 9 provinces and 9 regencies/cities in Indonesia. The study found that first; the school community already has a good understanding of the conception of digital literacy. Second, there was a good portrait and intense use of the detection of digital literacy capabilities, the understanding of the use of search engines, explorer applications, and active participation in social media, online learning, and digital communities with various capabilities. Third, the ability to read and write online has become a common activity carried primarily through the web like wattpad, rumah belajar, and media guru. The attention given to the three dimensions for detecting digital literacy competencies produces a good portrait that becomes the basis for building the digitally literate education community.

AB Digital revolution has deeply influenced and changed the way we learn and work, often blurring the boundaries between these two fields of human activity. Bearing in mind that modern ICTs are providing access to an immense stock of knowledge and information that is freely available online, knowledge workers, as ambassadors of the 21st century workforce, must possess a high degree of digital skills and competences. In order to prepare students for digital era labour market, educational institutions (higher education institutions in particular) are obliged to respond to the challenges that our highly digitized knowledge societies are imposing by incorporating digital literacy courses into their curricula. Such courses strive to instruct students as to how to critically use modern ICTs for retrieving, assessing, storing, producing, presenting and exchanging information, as well as for participating in collaborative networks in online environment.
   Under the Key Competences for Lifelong Learning - European Reference Framework, digital competence is set as one of the top priorities, along with the competences of communicating in mother tongue and foreign languages, mathematical and basic competences in science and technology, entrepreneurship and civic skills, the ability to acquire new knowledge and achieve a high degree of cultural awareness and expression. Working diligently to join the European Union, Serbia has adjusted its laws on education with those adopted in the EU. This particularly refers to the Serbian Law on Higher Education, which has been aligned (to the greatest extent possible) with the guidelines stipulated by the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Moreover, Serbian laws on education are advocating for an increased level of utilization of modern ICTs in the classroom. Hence, in 2013, the National Education Council of Serbia has adopted the document entitled Guidelines for promoting the role of information and communication technologies in education, the same year that the European Commission published DIGCOMP - a Framework for Developing and Understanding Digital Competence in Europe. The Education Development Strategy in Serbia until 2020 also recognizes the significance of using ICTs in teaching in order to improve Serbian education system.
   As one of the essential 21st century skills, digital literacy is increasingly becoming an integral part of Serbian education institutions' curricula. The paper aims at providing an overview of the official documents adopted in Serbia that are advocating for a greater level of implementation of ICTs in teaching and consequently digital literacy courses within the Serbian education system. Furthermore, we intend to present the current situation in terms of teaching digital literacy in Serbia as well as the initiatives and projects that have already been realized in the field. The later include The Digital school project and KODigranje campaign of the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, which was developed under the Battle for Knowledge initiative in order to increase the digital literacy of primary students, but also the Digital Youthquake project, which aimed at improving digital literacy skills of youth workers. In addition, we will reflect upon the place of Serbian Cyrillic alphabet on the Internet and discuss the opportunity of raising the level of its visibility online by means of fostering digital literacy within the Serbian education system.

AB This paper has a twin purpose: on the one hand, to create an instrument for assessing the digital skills of pupils in early childhood education (aged 3-6) based on their classroom practices; and on the other, to confirm the levels of autonomy acquired by the pupils in terms of digital skills. The study was conducted over the course of two school years, gathering data for a total of 254 pupils from 17 classrooms in eight schools working with an ICT resource. First of all, the results describe a classroom-based instrument designed and verified for the assessment of the pupils' digital skills. Furthermore, the results related to the levels of autonomy stress the importance that maturity factors, curricular content, and aspects associated with the nature of the classroom practice have for explaining the acquisition of digital skills. It is important to emphasize the need for further skills assessment studies adopting a classroom practice approach.

DE Bilingual students; intercultural didactic; computers; immigrants;
   virtual classrooms; anti-bias curriculum
AB Computer video games have become highly interesting to educators and researchers since their sophistication has improved considerably over the last decade. Studies indicate that even simple video games are offering important educational benefits in classrooms with bilingual students from different countries. However, a need for identifying truly useful game for educational purposes exists. This article begins with an examination of lower level learning in so-called edutainment products and concludes with an example of how teachers can use computer games and video based activities as an advanced way to improve and enrich the existing curriculum. On the other hand, as a teacher, it is important to be aware of such technology and to know that these instruments can all be used in the classroom in some way. Can games based learning helps in eliminating racism problems, assisting the acceptance in small communities of the new immigrants, and can assist the gifted and talented students in their future plans? This essay identifies characteristics of highly cognitive virtual interactive environments and offers a detailed index and scoring rubric as a tool for teachers and preserves teachers to use when evaluating the tendencies a video game demonstrates toward encouraging higher order thinking in its participants. Computers have been used in the classroom for years but now it has become so advanced that it allows teachers and students to use the computers in a more efficient way. Computer games have been developed for everything and anything, including topics such as typing, reading, math, science, foreign language training, etc. Research has been done to examine whether or not these games are useful to children. It appears that children are growing up in a technological world and that these games are useful to them because it is something familiar.

AB This case analysis is a study proposal on digital competencies in the journalist training curriculum, a model proposed from the intersection of Ferres and Piscitelli's proposal on the dimensions of Media Competence and DigComp developed by the European Commission. The object of study was the Bachelor of Social Communication at the Jose Simeon Canas of El Salvador Central American University due to its tradition of studies in journalism and its curricular adjustment in 2019 proposing a double presence and assuming the virtual before the pandemic.
   As a method, content analysis was used from the dimensions of digital competencies in their study plan. The results show that there is no deepening of the concept of competence is equivalent to skill and there is no description of what is understood as image and digital competence, limited spaces where students can generate elements of assessment and criticism of the use of the fourth screens, no topics were found that address content related to copyright, collective intelligence and especially Internet security as forms of protection of identity and personal information on the web and social networks, abuses and/or dependencies created by technology and personal care about the abuse of technologies.

AB Digital competence has gained a strong prominence in the educational context, being one of the key competencies that teachers must master in today's society. Although most models and frameworks focus on the pre-university level, there is a growing interest in knowing the state of digital competencies of university teachers, that is, the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for a teacher to make effective use of technologies. The aim of this research is to present a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus, to identify, analyze and classify the published articles between 2000 and 2021 on digital competences, and thus find and improve the research being done on digital skills and future avenues of teachers in the university context. The SciMAT software is used in the analysis. The initial search reveals more than 343 articles in English, of which 152 are duplicates and 135 are not related to the topic of study. After this filtering, 56 articles are obtained and analyzed in depth. The results reveal a predominance of research that focuses on analyzing teachers' self-assessment and reflection of their digital competencies. Teachers recognize that they have a low or medium-low digital competence, as well as the absence of certain competencies, especially those related to the evaluation of educational practice. Despite the multiple studies that address this issue, it is necessary to continue improving research in this area, deepening the assessment of teachers' digital competencies and design, on this basis, more practical and personalized training programs that respond to the needs of teachers in the digital era.

ID STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; UNIDIMENSIONALITY; PARADIGM; SCALE
AB Leveraging the capabilities of the web, which has become hugely popular among university students since its inception in the 90s, blended learning has been promoted as an alternative to classroom learning. A hybrid of classroom learning and online learning, blended learning offers flexibility in the way students learn - when, what, where, and how to learn. The easy availability of mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, etc.), coupled with web-based services (e.g. digital library, learning management systems, etc.), has further fuelled blended learning. Universities see online learning as complementary to classroom learning so as to give students a better learning experience, and students like the learning flexibility. As blended learning expects students to know how to use digital technology to access the web, to search for and to use information from different sources both online and offline, as well as to be an independent learner, it seems reasonable to presume that to be an effective learner in a blended learning environment, students need to have a certain level of digital literacy. Thus, there remains a question: Do students require digital literacy to be effective in learning in a blended learning environment? Answering this question helps universities to understand if high digital literacy is a prerequisite to more effective learning in a blended learning environment. If it is, universities can provide students with workshops to help raise digital literacy among them. Following a quantitative approach, this study conducted an online questionnaire survey to answer the question by examining the relationships between four digital literacy constructs; i.e. underpinnings, background knowledge, central competencies, and attitudes and perspectives; as conceptualised by David Bawden in his 2008 book chapter entitled "Origins and Concepts of Digital Literacy," and effective learning. This study developed a 5-item scale to operationalise each of the four digital literacy constructs and, using the revised Bloom's taxonomy as a point of departure, a 6-item scale for the effective learning construct. To collect responses from the students who were taking subjects in a blended learning environment at a local university, the students were invited to fill in an online questionnaire. Responses were then analyzed using partial least squares. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in the four digital literacy constructs being reduced to three. Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis proved that the three digital literacy constructs each had a statistically significant relationship with the effective learning construct.

AB This study examines digital competency (DigComp) as a crucial component of twenty-first century teachers. It investigates pre-service teachers' level of DigComp from their perspective, and whether they felt their preparation programme qualified them for digital education. One hundred forty student teachers in their final year of majoring in either art education or kindergarten at a public university in Saudi Arabia participated. Data was collected via an online survey that included five DigComp areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving. Significant differences were found between the two groups: the communication and collaboration domain had the highest mean in both groups (152.47+19.39; 139.40+ 17.79); while the safety domain had the lowest mean score in both groups (16.48+2.62; 15.06+3.35). Results showed that 77.1% of pre-service teachers rated their DigComp as excellent and 22.9% rated it as moderate. The results further revealed that the pre-service teacher programme was average (65.04%) in qualifying pre-service teachers to integrate technology into their future teaching practices. The results of this study highlight the necessity to evaluate pre-service teacher programmes for suitability to produce instructors who possess the cognitive, teaching, and digital competencies required in the era of technology.

AB The objective of this research was to analyze how the digital skills of teachers in the communication course in high school generated learning in times of pandemic. The qualitative approach was applied as a methodology, based on the socio-critical interpretive model and grounded theory design, well-founded, using the semi-structured interview with a sample of three teachers from the area of communication, six students and six parents of the third and fourth grades, through the a priori matrix and triangulation. The results show that the government provision for remote work, the educational community received it very dissatisfied, since there were no conditions to face a remote education, whose face-to-face separation implied putting digital skills into practice, with teachers finding themselves at the basic level with step to intermediate, thanks to their self-training and training, achieving not very satisfactory learning, because several students had little use of the cell phone, limited internet, others did not have, some climbed the trees or highest hills in their area, or they were developing the reprints satisfactorily. On the other hand, parents expressed that this pandemic doubled their responsibilities towards their children. In conclusion, learning in the area of communication is linked to digital skills with the student's available material, otherwise, learning is weakened in distance education, so it is time to promote challenges in the face of digital literacy.

AB This study aimed to investigate the attitudes towards e-learning and digital literacy skills of prospective teachers (N = 47) enrolled in the Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology at a state university in Turkey. The study also investigated whether these variables vary in terms of gender and prior e-learning experience as well as the potential relationship between their attitudes and their digital literacy skills. Adopting a quasi-experimental pre-posttest design with an experimental group, this study sought to discover the effects of a five-week treatment on prospective teachers' digital literacy skills and attitudes toward e-learning. The data for the study came from two data collection tools namely, Attitudes towards E-learning Scale (Haznedar & Baran, 2012) and Digital Literacy Scale (Ng, 2012). Findings indicated the effectiveness of the treatment on the participants' attitudes towards e-learning platforms. Furthermore, the findings of the regression tests demonstrated that tendency is one of the most significant predictors of digital literacy skills.

AB For the planning and implementation of lessons with digital technologies, a subject-specific technology-related professional competence of teachers is of central importance. However, the competency frameworks developed so far remain in a general perspective and do not explicitly address subject-specific issues. Furthermore, digital competencies are predominantly measured with subject-unspecific self-assessment instruments, as subject-specific operationalizations for this area are not yet available in a differentiated form. In this article, the framework for Digital Competencies for Teaching in Science Education (DiKoLAN), a subject-specific framework for pre-service science teachers, is introduced, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, first results of a self-assessment tool based on the framework are described. DiKoLAN defines competency areas highly specific to science, as well as more general competency areas that include aspects common to all subjects. Each competency area is described by competency expectations, which, in turn, are structured with reference to the four technology-related dimensions of the TPACK framework (i.e., Technological and Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and three levels of performance (Name, Describe, Use/Apply). Derived from DiKoLAN, a corresponding self-assessment instrument (DiKoLAN-Grid) was developed and empirically tested for the two competency areas, (n = 118) and Information Search and Evaluation (n = 90), in biology student teachers. By means of path models, tendencies regarding structural correlations of the four components Special Tools (TK), Content-specific Context (TCK), Methods and Digitality (TPK), and Teaching (TPACK) are presented for both competency areas and discussed, as well as in comparison to previously conducted, subject-unspecific surveys.

DE digital literacy; informal learning; digital media
AB New technologies and developments in media are transforming the way that individuals, groups and societies communicate, learn, work and govern. This new socio-technical reality requires participants to possess not only skills and abilities related to the use of technological tools, but also knowledge regarding the norms and practices of appropriate usage. To be digitally literate' in this way encompasses issues of cognitive authority, safety and privacy, creative, ethical, and responsible use and reuse of digital media, among other topics. A lack of digital literacy increasingly implicates one's full potential of being a competent student, an empowered employee or an engaged citizen. Digital literacy is often considered a school-based competency, but it is introduced and developed in informal learning contexts such as libraries, museums, social groups, affinity spaces online, not to mention the home environment. This article recognizes and connects the ways and places we might conceptualize and realize an expanded view of digital literacy that fits today's changing reality.

The results were organized in a matrix and then systematized to continue with the study and its application in the teaching work context through the selection of seven models that have a wide trajectory in the pedagogical field. Once the key concepts were defined and the relevant theoretical connections about distance, open and online education were established, a model of digital teaching competencies was elaborated for this educational modality. This seeks to strengthen the figure of the teacher, whose work cannot be paralyzed and much less displaced by the lack of knowledge in a specific educational modality or the implementation of the various technological tools available today, as happened with COVID-19.

AB The digital competence has a great importance and boom in the European framework, given the recommendations given by this agency for lifelong learning. This fact requires some teachers with a consolidated base in said competence, so that they can transmit it to the students, and with it, comply with the recommendations marked from Europe. The purpose of this research is to describe and relate the branch of training of the students of the Master's Degree in Compulsory Secondary Education, Baccalaureate, Vocational Training and Language Teaching in the Campus of Ceuta with the area of digital competence of information and information literacy. The method applied in the study is quantitative, with descriptive and correlative scope, by non-experimental design, and longitudinal paradigm. The sample is 153 students. The instrument used is a questionnaire developed from the rubric created by the Common Framework of Digital Teaching Competence in 2017. The results show that the students' competence level is between A2 and B1 in the area of information and digital literacy. It is concluded that the training branch of future teachers is not an influential element in the competence level in the area named above

AB We present this paper as the result of an educational research project conducted at the School of Architecture of Barcelona (ETSAB) during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic course. The project is based on a case study, focused on the sequence of the first academic course of undergraduate studies that begins with the Welcome Course (initial course on computer graphics) and ends with Drawing II equivalent to the introductory course on descriptive geometry. With it we propose to use a reverse teaching strategy, where future architecture students begin by using ICT tools and 3D technologies, rather than traditional drawing. Given the interest that they arouse in them and the ease of digital literacy, the results of the students' training in graphics, visual education, space understanding, and their academic performance and satisfaction are much higher than the usual ones, besides being achieved in a shorter period of time.

ID SCREEN INFERIORITY; PAPER
AB This study mapped instructional strategies that promote core digital literacies, as conceptualized by three theoretical frameworks: the digital competencies (DC) model (Eshet-Alkalai, 2004; 2012) the five core-competencies (5C) model (Hwang, Lai, & Wang, 2015) and the DigComp framework (Ferrari, 2013). Findings from a large qualitative sample of 65 Israeli elementary and middle-school teachers-experts in technology-enhanced pedagogy, demonstrated that their perspectives in semi-structured interviews were mostly consistent with their actual behavior observed in classrooms. Teachers over-emphasized certain competencies (searching for knowledge, photo-visual thinking, socio-emotional learning, constructing knowledge), while others competencies were significantly less common (real-time thinking, branching literacy and problem-solving skills). Based on bottom-up coding, we identified unique characteristics of digital literacy, suggested several modifications of the DC, 5C and DigComp frameworks, and mapped the level of instructional strategies (foundational, intermediate, or advanced) used to develop students' digital literacies. We discuss the implications of the findings for educational theory and practice.

DE digital skills; virtual laboratories; engineering education; traditional
   laboratories
AB The "hunger" of engineers with digital skills globally is growing through the last 20 years. The laboratory work is an essential part of the engineering higher education process. The laboratory is where the science is experienced and where the students turn the theoretical knowledge into practical skills. The virtual laboratory concept has developed based on the evolution of the ICT and has the main task to provide the users with comprehensive tools to conduct experiments remotely as if they were in the "traditional" lab. The features of the virtual lab include global access and assurance of connected learning for users geographically separated. In addition, its functionality provides a user friendly environment for a secured access to expensive equipment, digital libraries, educational potential and instruments for team work.
   The purpose of this article is to test the change of user's digital skills and attitudes of student's engineers as a result of their work in a VL. The VL was created and dedicated to future engineers studying Industrial Engineering in the Technical University of Sofia. The methods used are theoretical analysis and synthesis, pedagogical modelling and questionnaire.
   The theoretical analysis and synthesis show that VL flexibility makes them easy to cooperate with other directions of modern education methods such as serious games and m-learning.
   The questionnaire was conducted with Industrial Engineering students (no ICT specialization or ICT focused education) of the Technical University of Sofia. The results show that working in the virtual laboratories enhances the digital skills of users, teaching them working with contemporary communication tools, developing the ability to solve complicated tasks in a digital environment. Working in virtual laboratories, the students process information to use it with other software applications, providing them with a connection for better and sustainable acquisition of knowledge and experience exchange. The work in the virtual laboratories motivates students and enriches digital skills. It enables users to make use of digital technologies in transformative ways, including abilities that form the basis of engineering.
   The frame of digital skills established by the European Commission was used in the survey in order to prove that the developed virtual laboratory possess the necessary integrated capacity to be used as a tool for supporting the Digitising European Industry.
   Despite the potential of VLs they are still hardly developed and less used in engineering higher education - the USA and recently UK have a significant success with the implementation of the concept unlike other regions. Creating and VL in the framework of mobile learning is still a challenge that requires collaboration between scientists from different fields. The inertia of many universities needs to be overcome to facilitate the implementation of virtual laboratories into regular learning programs.

AB UniCampus, online learning environment started in 2014, as an attempt to provide the first Romanian language MOOC-like Massive Open Online Courses. For the development of the DigiCulture project we decided to extend the existing UniCampus platform with a new DigiCulture theme. This paper presents the technical development, based on the Moodle framework, with new user interactions. The DigiCulture project develops free, online short courses dedicated to adults with low digital skills. The shortage of digital skills in Europe reported in 2016 in European Digital Progress Report EDPR of the European Commission: 45% of Europeans have insufficient or no digital skills. As there are big differences between the countries that are partners in DigiCulture, we propose an integrated approach for course development, but with national personalization as language, study cases. These implementation and personalization are presented in this paper.

AB Due to COVID-19, universities faced the challenge of moving to the virtual modality, carrying out processes of adaptation to the digital environment and integrating technological tools in classes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the digital skills of university teachers from two higher education institutions in Colombia. For data collection, the instrument implemented was the questionnaire on the digital competence of Higher Education teachers, which consists of 4 dimensions and 112 items. 105 teachers participated in the study, the study was quantitative, non-experimental and descriptive in scope. SPSS 22 software was used for data analysis and descriptive and correlational statistics were performed. Based on the results, it is highlighted that teachers use TIC in an instrumental way. The conclusions focus on the need to venture into content creation, augmented reality, innovation programs, strengthening research and the use of specific digital tools for each area of knowledge. A call is made to teachers and universities to continue promoting training and support programs to actively implement TIC in classes that require teacher qualification in educa-tional processes.

AB As we have seen as a consequence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our scientific-technological society requires a transformation of knowledge in a global, digital and virtual manner. In light of this, and to improve the public health skills of professionals working to promote health education, one of the current priorities is to train pre-service teachers on how to search for health-related scientific knowledge relating to bio-health through digital literacy in health. The objectives of this study were to determine the level of eHealth literacy, scientific knowledge in health and confidence on the part of students, analyzing the degree of improvement following a teaching intervention with students of the Bachelor's Degree of Education of the University of Extremadura. A quasi-experimental longitudinal study was carried out with pre-test and post-test groups and a mixed data analysis. It involved the application of an active cooperative methodology with tutoring using the jigsaw technique, with the use of four quality digital browsers to enhance scientific rigor. The results show that the initial level of eHealth literacy and confidence was problematic. Following the intervention with the cooperative methodology, both these levels and the level of scientific knowledge in health reached an excellent level. In conclusion, this suggests that university training programs need to be implemented to improve digital and scientific skills in health education as they are currently insufficient. It has been demonstrated that a cooperative active methodology improved these levels and accordingly its use in active and digital higher education should be promoted.

AB Learning in the digital age is a pervasive idea that encompasses all aspects of a person's life, including work and leisure. As a result of the development of new teaching and learning tools, an increasing number of students are acquiring knowledge on the Internet-connected to the Internet. Therefore, all citizens must develop digital literacy as a lifelong learning skill. Studies have been conducted on students' digital skills in higher education institutions. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the skills of college students. The participants were students from a university in the Kazan region of Russia who volunteered to participate. Three hundred and eighty students completed the questionnaire online. The scale consists of a total of 25 questions and six dimensions. Since our independent variables are binary values, we applied the Bayesian t-test. We obtained the values of the Bayes factor (BF10) for each dimension and the total scale. In general, students' digital skills are well-developed. However, it was found that creating and using digital information requires fewer skills than in other areas. The hypothesis that there is no difference based on student gender was supported to a higher degree but not to a very high degree. The hypothesis that there is no difference based on students' fields of study was supported to a greater extent, but only to a moderate extent.

AB Educationalists' and policymakers' curriculum work on digital literacy in England has overlooked the expertise of digital specialists such as information, IT and media professionals. Given the lack of evidence, this article draws on semi-structured interviews with experts in the United Kingdom, enhanced by a diary methodology and a conversational approach to the think aloud method, to explore how they engage with and evaluate online content. In doing so, it addresses what digital literacy entails and how to promote it across the national curriculum for England. It is argued that the ability to evaluate online content involves not only reflections on the nature and origin of information, contextual knowledge and the use of multiple sources, but also functional and critical digital skills and knowledge about the internet and the digital environment. Belatedly, it is argued that the Citizenship and Computing curricula should be revised to promote digital literacy as a cross-curricular subject.

The project was one of a number of work packages developed throughout 2007-2008, in this case a dance learning objects package, to assist student engagement with the university's virtual learning environment (VLE). The dance learning objects package was developed, trialled, and is now in place. In developing these materials, the interest was in how the digital dance objects that we were creating for a parallel project the AHRC-funded Siobhan Davies Archive, which is an online digital archive could be developed into learning objects and how this might lead to the development of new ways of teaching and learning, new assessment methods, and the development of further dance learning objects.

DE digital literacy; video; reflection; trainee teachers
AB Addressing the digital literacy skills of trainee teachers is a key theme for educators who need to support learning in a digitally-rich world. Part of this theme, audio-visual media, provides a rich medium for teaching and learning. Video can effectively communicate complex information to a learner and can assist trainee teachers when reflecting on their own practice. Rather than having to rely on an individual's recall of an event, it can be used as a basis for reflection and professional growth (using the stimulated recall research method). The inclusion of video capture, sharing and editing skills in the training of novice teachers is designed to equip trainees with a set of digital literacy skills that will enable them to exploit video in order to create motivating, memorable and inclusive learning experiences for their learners.
   Following on from an initial pilot study, where trainee teachers were introduced to video as a channel for reflection, the paper reports on the next stage of the study. Working in inter-disciplinary groups, the aim of the next stage was to enable the trainees to develop a greater understanding of subject knowledge enhancement that draws on their subject knowledge but applies it in an interdisciplinary way.
   The study investigates the extent to which trainees have benefited from video-based reflection, even when done apart from a group. With the inclusion of a reflection framework, (that trainees are able to download and include in their e-portfolios), the study explores to what extent individuals using this mode of reflection have provided longer and more specific reflections than when writing a reflection using memory alone. The study also explores to what extent has the inclusion of video helped trainee teachers focus their attention on their students' learning rather than on their own experiences.

AB Digital literacy is sufficiently important to be incorporated into education at all levels, especially at the tertiary level, which is responsible for producing human resources with high working competency and high ability to live in the changing environment of the digital society. This paper is part of the research study on the development of digital literacy in Thai higher education. The research aims at investigating the digital literacy level of the students in Thai higher education based on the opinions of faculty members and the current students. The quantitative research method was applied with a survey conducted to collect information from the target group that consisted of 500 faculty members and 1,000 students of 116 Thai universities. The respondents were asked to rate the level of students' digital literacy skills which comprised of 5 core skills which the researcher synthesized from previous frameworks, guidelines and researches. The skills include information, reproduction, hypermedia, communication, and socio-emotional skills. The data was analyzed into means, and standard deviations. The findings revealed that the respondents rated the students have the communication skills at high level, but the others are at moderate levels listed in order of mean values: socio-emotional, information, reproduction, and hypermedia skills respectively. The analysis of 21 sub-skills of digital literacy; the skills in the use of digital technology for communication, learning, working, and leading in everyday life, found that the followings are top ten skills of students: communication, collaboration, dissemination, accession, expression, digital citizenship, interpretation, responsibility, statement, and reflection. The findings in this phase will be used for the next step of this research on the development of digital literacy in Thai higher education.

AB There is little consensus about the nature of teachers' digital competencies in Higher Education. Moreover, existing digital competence frameworks have largely been developed for teachers in secondary education. In response to this, the current study focuses on developing and validating a framework of digital competencies for teachers in Higher Education. First, a review was conducted to determine the state of digital competence research regarding dimensions and definition of digital competence. In a next step, similarities and differences between existing digital competence frameworks were identified. Based on the outcomes of the review and the framework comparison, a framework was developed in an iterative process through expert meetings with policy makers, experts in the field of educational technology, and validated with practitioners. The new framework includes four dimensions of teachers' digital competencies: (1) Teaching practice, (2) Empowering students for a digital society, (3) Teachers' digital literacy, and (4) Teachers' professional development. The resulting Higher Education Digital Competence (HeDiCom) framework will provide guidance and clearer expectations of teachers' digital competency. Ultimately, improving teachers' digital competencies will contribute to improving the quality of digital competencies of the students.

AB Changes in the digital economy are raising concerns that a digital literacy divide is emerging, where some groups are falling behind in their skills and have less access to new technology. The rapidly developing digital economy is increasing the demand for digitally literate individuals. To be digitally literate, one must be equipped with appropraite tools and skills necssary to compete and succeed. Normally people tend to assume that youths are digital natives however exposure to technology alone does not consider as digital literate person. So far there is no established studies that confirm the factors that improve the young individuals to be digitally literate. Purpose of the study is to investigate the factors that impact on young individuals to be digtial literate and also to access the outcomes of digital literacy. Finally this study propose the digital literacy framework that can be implemented in higher education sector in Malaysia. The expected outcome is to identify set of digital skills and styles that young adults should have in order be digitally literate so as to enhance in academic performance and employment opportunities. This study will also contribute to policy and practices as the provided digital literacy framework that can be implemented in higher education sector in Malaysia.

AB Competitiveness Operational Program 2014-2020, the European Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and for economic, social and territorial cohesion, has the second priority axis Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for competitive digital economy. These actions will promote e-learning and enhancing digital literacy, which will enable people of all ages to acquire knowledge and skills in a particular field. The set of actions will enhance the learning process through greater involvement of students using ICT, thus producing a strong impact on their school performance, with the potential to reduce the dropout rate and increasing labor competitiveness in a global market. Improving digital skills will thus be a major contributor to e-inclusion, creating new opportunities and resources for growth. The actions are directed towards education, as main field, in order to enable the development of skills and digital literacy, increasing use of ICT in learning process (OER, Web 2.0) and developing ICT skills (Operational Program Competitiveness, prepared by the Ministry of European Funds, consultation document, March 2014). These priorities can be achieved through the implementation of projects aimed at using ICT in schools and at the development of digital skills of the educational actors, both in learning process and in the continuing education of teachers. The Romanian country profile described in The Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2013 states that only 26% of teachers use ICT for students' projects or class work (vs. a 34% EU average). In these circumstances, we intend to conduct a study, using both quantitative and qualitative research methods, among primary school teachers from secondary school from Brasov, Romania. The questions we intend to answer are related to equipping of schools with the means of using ICT in the learning process, using of educational software in current learning process, using of multimedia tools, using of Google applications in classrooms, identifying training needs of teachers in terms of digital skills in the context of introducing digital textbooks at primary level.

AB This article aims to problematize the concept of digital literacy from experiences using Information and Communication Digital Technologies (ICDT) in a six-hour course planned for teacher education context. Six undergraduate students took part in this minicourse. Our intention is to provide opportunities for reflection on the opportunities and digital didactic resources of our time while providing that the discussions take place also mediated by these technologies. In this way, the participants of the minicourse were invited to take a meta-analytical look at the tool, that is, to use and reflect on how to use it. This qualitative interpretive study is guided by the theory of Multiliteracies and aims to discuss how we can contribute to the improvement of critical digital literacy of teachers and consequently favor work based on the theory of critical literacy resignified also among their students.

AB For some years, teachers' digital skills have been critical to the educational process; nevertheless, with the health catastrophe released by Covid-19, they have become critical. So, the purpose of this study was to examine and quantify the degree of digital literacy among instructors of Regular Basic Education at UGEL Tacna. The study used a hybrid quantitative-qualitative methodology and was mostly descriptive in nature. There were 1,329 teachers in the population and sample. The questionnaire and the interview were employed as instruments. The findings suggest that 49.89% teachers had a high degree of digital competence, while 12.19% have a basic level, which includes instructors at the elementary, primary, and secondary levels. Instructors get knowledge about web 2.0 technologies and their utility and application via interviews; it is advised that teachers enhance cognitive digital abilities. That is, the investigative skills geared toward the virtual environment and their development in pupils. It concludes by identifying the most critical training needs associated with the cognitive digital domain's medium-low level, establishing the necessity of developing a strengthening plan for cognitive digital skills that have not been developed satisfactorily, particularly in the creation of digital educational materials and related educational projects.

AB Objectives Conduct a scoping review to identify the approaches used to integrate digital literacy into undergraduate pharmacy programs across different countries, focusing on methods for education, training, and assessment.Materials and methods Following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, we searched 5 electronic databases in June 2022: MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL. Three independent reviewers screened all articles; data extraction was conducted by 2 reviewers. Any discrepancies were arbitrated by 2 additional reviewers.Results Out of 624 articles, 57 were included in this review. Educational and training approaches for digital literacy in undergraduate pharmacy programs encompassed a theoretical understanding of health informatics, familiarization with diverse digital technologies, and applied informatics in 2 domains: patient-centric care through digital technologies, and the utilization of digital technologies in interprofessional collaboration. Blended pedagogical strategies were commonly employed. Assessment approaches included patient plan development requiring digital information retrieval, critical appraisal of digital tools, live evaluations of telehealth skills, and quizzes and exams on health informatics concepts. External engagement with system developers, suppliers, and other institutes supported successful digital literacy education.Discussion and conclusion This scoping review identifies various learning objectives, teaching, and assessment strategies to incorporate digital literacy in undergraduate pharmacy curricula. Recommendations include acknowledging the evolving digital health landscape, ensuring constructive alignment between learning objectives, teaching approach and assessments, co-development of digital literacy courses with stakeholders, and using standardized guidelines for reporting educational interventions. This study provides practical suggestions for enhancing digital literacy education in undergraduate pharmacy programs.

AB The Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns enforced by many countries resulted in indispensable adjustments to the way people live and communicate. The introduction of online education in secondary and tertiary education was one such adjustment and gave rise to a new dynamic whose educational angle and potential were unknown to many teachers. Special Education teachers in particular encountered difficulties with online teaching, stemming from a number of issues common in their field: lack of uniformity special education cases present; the confusion and stress of special needs learners when faced with the teacher's physical absence; a dearth in studies on teaching Music Technology to people with mental disabilities; and the fact that Music Technology necessitates that learners already be in possession of certain digital skills. The present study aims at presenting not only its researchers' systematic recording of their teaching approach but also of the researchers' actions (March 2020 lockdown-present) regarding the teaching of Music Technology online to a learner with Down syndrome, through differentiated teaching, motivation, steady interaction, and communication. Assessment was accomplished through systematic observation of the learning process, successful completion by the special needs learner of specially designed actions, and semi-structured interviews at the end of every session.

AB Digital literacy has emerged as a core competency in the 21st century society, and deep learning and higher-order thinking have been discussed as effective ways to improve digital literacy. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the influence of deep learning and higher-order thinking skills on higher education students' digital literacy. Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the data gathered from 687 undergraduate and higher vocational students using a convenient sampling technique. The findings indicate that deep motivation and deep strategy were significantly positively correlated with students' digital literacy. In such a structural relationship, digital literacy was additionally moderated by higher-order thinking. Nevertheless, students who have customarily used digital devices for more than five years could not be explained by this structural equation model. Lastly, this conclusion highlighted that educators should consider students' digital experiences level, guide in selecting and applying deep learning, develop higher-order thinking, and improve their digital literacy.

Using text mining, it reviews 1037 research articles published on the topic between 2000 and 2020. This review reveals that there is a plurality of terms associated with digital literacy. Moreover, our research identifies six key factors that define the literature, which are information literacy, developing digital literacy, digital learning, ICT, social media, and twenty-first century digital skills. These factors can be grouped into three main streams, which are 1) digital literacy, 2) digital learning and 3) twenty-first century digital skills. These three streams are supported by informational and technological foundations. These results provide research avenues and offer a framework for digital literacy in education.

AB Digital Literacy is widely considered to be an essential attribute for both academic and professional success. In an increasingly regulated and standards-based higher education environment, however, there is a lack of clear guidance as to what constitutes the nature of appropriate level of Digital Literacy that graduates need to demonstrate. This paper argues for the designing framework for developing a learning environment to enhance Digital Literacy in the higher education curriculum, which can then be applied to student activities and the curriculum. This process can be used to assist academics in identifying the literacy requirements of their courses, their own opportunities for professional development and the creation of appropriate classroom pedagogies. The present study found that the taxonomy for the design and development of learning environments constituted elements of learning environments which facilitated students' creation of knowledge. Such taxonomy also consisted of elements of Digital Literacy which were learning tasks which helped students enhance Digital Literacy.

AB Serious games are the focus of the current research agenda. They show promise for allowing students to learn and practice skills. In fewer studies, they are used for the development of academic competencies. Therefore, it is of interest to deepen the research on the benefits of serious games in academic education and training. This article presents a study using serious games aimed at higher education academics' training for the development of digital competencies. The study was carried out with 56 academics, using the serious game called AstroCodigo. The study analyzed the level of acceptance of serious games using the TAM model and what factors the academics believe affect this acceptance. It is important to know possible barriers that affect the development of actions oriented to the formation of academic competencies through serious games, which can also affect the adoption of games as a resource for teaching situations. None of prior studies have focused on analyzing the technological acceptance of serious games used for the development of academic competencies. The results of this research indicate that participants believe that using serious games can be beneficial to drive digital competencies. However, there are aspects such as the highest academic qualification, work experience, professional development, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and fear of change associated with age rank which can play a negative role in the use and acceptance of digital technologies by academics, particularly serious games. These results may be a clue to the barriers linked to the fact that most of the participants in this study do not use serious games in their classes or for their digital skills training. Additionally, the possibility to try and fail and the increased level of challenges proposed in the serious games, related to enjoyment, were valued by academics, during the sessions with AstroCodigo. These findings open the door to organize strategies for academic training in digital competencies within higher education institutions. They can also impact the design decisions of new serious games.

AB The objective is to systematize the research located in warehouses and databases referring to Digital Competences in Basic Education teachers based on a bibliographic review; for which the documentary analysis and review method was used with a sample of 29 articles located in warehouses and scientific information bases such as redalyc, Scopus, Scielo, Ebsco, academic google, the Trilce plataform corresponding to the university. The findings showed that digital competence has been understood as a system of vital skills that is useful in virtual spaces that serve to develop learning experiences and improve teacher training and performance. The theoretical constructs of connectivism and constructionism as theoretical approaches support digital skills based on learning processes, use of media and information for the generation of a digital community through networks; as well as the use and variety of a system generated through virtual interaction of different types; because assuming them means developing adaptations for the teaching and learning processes that include feedback in the training processes in which criticism, analysis, communication, research and reflection are inserted. Teachers in their work performance use is related to the management of information and development of skills, communication and collaboration capacity, creation of digital content, application of actions for media safety in virtual activities and to solve problems in learning environments in the academic relationships of learning experiences.

AB The focus of this paper is a project conducted in 2011, exploring the use of YouTube in the classroom. The project conducted a number of focus groups for which highlighted a number of issues surrounding independent informal learning environments. The questions posed by this research are concerned with what constitutes learning in these spaces; how valid this is perceived to be by the students and how they engage with materials in this space. A question also posed was how cognisant the students are of their learning in these spaces and how they perceive the efficacy of the materials to support and enhance their learning. The research uncovered how the students interacted with each other in these informal spaces and the role that YouTube video content plays in community formation and supporting informal peer learning. The nature of informal learning spaces being that their focus being not solely of education, but also of entertainment leads to a variation in quality, reliability and suitability of content. The research also explored the students' digital literacy, uncovering the strategies used to first navigate in these spaces and then critically engage, analyse and assess materials that they may find.

AB Here, we add to the growing body of e-learning and teaching literature by examining the digital literacy of full-time and adjunct faculty at a public regional secondary education institution, examining the relationship between digital literacy and technology self-efficacy and understanding the role that digital immigration status plays in faculty's technology-based choices. How faculty's digital literacy translates into hybrid and online teaching environments and how faculty categorize their technologically based self-efficacy is also explored, particularly the role of user-based decision making through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Findings suggest that, to engage digitally immigrant and digitally native faculty teaching with technology, training should be scaffolded, with a particular focus on screening and assessing potential participants, with a focus on rigorous training that moves faculty from one stage or behavior change to another. Other suggestions and implications for strengthening online teaching pedagogy are discussed.

AB This study tries to figure out mathematical and digital skills during the teaching process of potential flow of fluids, using Wolfram Mathematica software, in the course "Matematicas Aplicadas a la Aeronautica (MAA)" at "Facultad Regional Haedo, Universidad Tecnologica Nacional (FRH-UTN)". Lesson plans on potential flow was outlined, where the students worked in groups using Wolfram Mathematica software, online version to solve them. The lesson plans were divided into activities related to applications, representation, understanding, research, exploration and analysis of elemental potential flows. In order to assess the mathematical and digital skills involved in these activities, a rubric instrument was created. This article shows the activities of the lesson plans, the rubric and the outcomes obtained. Results show that the students have several difficulties in mathematical and digital skills. This process requires dedication and detailed planification.

AB The objective of this work is to analyze the skills that the teachers and students of the Faculty of Information Sciences of the Autonomous University of San Luis Po-tosi (UASLP) have developed since the confinement due to the health contingency by Covid 19. 130 students of that faculty, 10 teachers and 17 subjects taught during the period from March 2020 to June 2021, surveys were applied that inquire about the technological and didac-tic skills put into practice for 12 months. In the case of students, the economic situation and internet accessi-bility were also inquired about. It was concluded that both teachers and students have adapted to the online teaching-learning process and that although their digi-tal skills are adequate, this is not enough to achieve the learning objectives.

ID COMPETENCE; DEVICES
AB Based on the theoretical framework of the DigCompEdu this article analyses the digital skills that teachers put into practice when using mobile devices in university classrooms in innovative educational experiences. To achieve this goal a mixed investigation was designed in which two data collection techniques were used. In addition, three discussion groups were developed in several Spanish universities aimed at understanding what meanings teachers attributed to the type of skills that were being put into practice in the development of innovative educational processes in which mobile devices were being used. This article presents the results of a questionnaire in which a sample of 155 teachers from different Spanish universities participated. All the teachers involved had participated in teaching innovation processes with mobile devices. The results suggest that university teachers possess digital skills that enable them to use mobile devices for the selection of digital resources. The participating teachers suggest that, beyond the devices used, the innovative nature of the experiences is related to the way in which these are involved in projects designed for innovation and improvement, taking full advantage of their potential for communication and access to information.

AB In this article, we present findings of a research study centered around a 10-week digital production workshop developed specifically for families in an urban school board, a population rich with culturally diverse immigrant families and English language learners (ELLs). The aim of this research was to support parents/guardians in an urban community in their development of a practical, hands-on understanding of twenty-first century literacies, using a 'production pedagogy' framework that emphasizes learner agency. We sought to critically reflect, alongside parents/guardians, on how new media and new literacies are being utilized in schools today, and to provide models, tools and practices for parents/guardians and their children to enact digital competences together, specifically, through the production of a short digital story.

AB Introduction Amidst claims that rapid technological changes in health far outstrip the capabilities of the health workforce, digital literacy is featured in occupational therapy competency standards. However, little attention have been given to the development of digital literacy in entry-level occupational therapy programmes and the preparation of graduates for digital health. There is a lack of guidance on how universities can demonstrate digital literacy development in occupational therapy students. The aim of this study was to test the usefulness of a digital literacy framework and mapping tool in identifying opportunities for students to develop digital literacy within an entry-level occupational therapy programme.
   Methods Intrinsic case study design was used to test the usefulness of the digital literacy framework and mapping tool. The framework and tool were applied to the curriculum of a large entry-level Australian occupational therapy programme.
   Results Through the process of mapping, key insights were developed on how digital literacy was embedded across the occupational therapy curricula. Limited attention was given to the development of student digital literacy in the early years of the programme. In later years, more opportunities were available to develop digital literacy at basic and intermediate levels. Across the programme, there was limited evidence of the development of advanced digital literacy.
   Conclusions The framework and mapping tool were useful in broadening understanding of the concept of digital literacy beyond information communication technologies. The framework and tool can assist those designing or refining occupational therapy curricula to operationalise the notion of digital literacy for practice, and prompt discussion and debate on digital literacy and requirements for students, graduates and occupational therapists in an ever-changing complex health environment.

AB This paper presents a teaching experience in social psychology learning, aimed at students' acquisition of critical analysis and digital literacy competences at the University of Barcelona. The methodology consisted of asking each student to answer to a socially relevant question, by means of (a) identifying key underlying psychosocial processes and (b) searching for adequate keywords in scientific databases such as PsycNet and Sociological Abstracts, in order to (c) select and critically compare two relevant articles that could answer this question. The acquisition of these competences was assessed with a rubric and related questions in the final exam. Results indicated both the effectiveness of this approach to teach competences in digital literacy and critical analysis through motivating questions, and the translation of these competences in other situations. This approach also showed to be more effective in teaching these ompetences than only giving lectures. This methodology is promising, as it provides an answer to how to give future professionals competences in answering effectively and rigorously to socially relevant problems in the Information Society.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of blogs on teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) to primary students. The study also explores educators' perceptions of social media tools and digital literacy in school environments.
   Design/methodology/approach - A three-step approach was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. First, the blogs of 23 fifth-grade students in an EFL class in Kuwait was analysed for one semester along with student perceptions and teacher observations. Second, a survey was distributed to the students at the end of the semester, and finally, four focus groups were conducted regarding educators' perceptions on the use of social media, their skills and needs and problems encountered.
   Findings - The findings showed that by the end of the semester, students were writing lengthy sentences, had fewer spelling and grammatical mistakes, were more motivated and independent and displayed a more positive attitude towards learning EFL. In addition, educators are enthusiastic about using Web technologies in their teaching practices but have several concerns such as digital literacy competencies, technology-use behaviour and lack of accessibility to digital content.
   Research limitations/implications - The number of questions on the student survey could be reduced. Also, it would be preferable in future studies to require all students to blog at least twice a week which could provide a broader representation of their writing abilities.
   Originality/value - Little research has been reported in the literature on the use of blogs in teaching EFL to primary school students. Most literature focuses on teaching EFL to university students. By using a mixed-methodology approach, this study also highlights the needs of educators and students in technology learning environments and makes a good contribution towards offering pragmatic solutions.

ID DATA INFORMATION LITERACY
AB Digital literacy has been cited as one of the primary challenges to ensuring data reuse and increasing the value placed on open science. Incorporating published data into classrooms and training is at the core of tackling this issue. This article presents case studies in teaching with different published data platforms, in three different countries (the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States), to students at different levels and with differing skill levels. In outlining their approaches, successes, and failures in teaching with open data, it is argued that collaboration with data publishers is critical to improving data reuse and education. Moreover, increased opportunities for digital skills training and scaffolding across program curriculum are necessary for managing the learning curve and teaching students the values of open science.

AB This article outlines a model for teaching undergraduate and graduate archaeology students the skills for working with open-access archaeological data and using digital tools for analysis. Due to the often limited opportunities for students to learn methods directly for data reuse, large archaeological datasets remain stagnant and unused in digital archives. The bloat of unused data stands as a major ethical hurdle in heritage fields. This article explores an approach for addressing this issue, which is to incorporate data and digital literacy training into standard archaeological curricula. This approach consists of covering a wide range of topics that contribute to digital and data fluency that include both practical digital skills and discussions aimed at contextualizing the tools into larger, ethical, and sociopolitical frameworks. This article offers summaries of the activities and tutorials developed for this project and provides open access to all of the resources for future use.

AB For their future career, nonprofit students need to attain the necessary skills and knowledge to leverage the power of technology appropriately to serve their communities. As faculty, we need to design our courses to improve the digital literacy of our students and therefore improve their ability to effectively communicate, manage, and lead public service organizations. This article examines an undergraduate course called Community Organizations in a Digital World that responds to the new demands for innovations in nonprofit organizations. We present the overall course design, including assignments, and the findings of a pretest and a posttest of individual student digital literacy and student reflections on their digital literacy. Based on the two-stage survey, students' digital literacy significantly improved when they completed the course. Moreover, students appreciated the importance and the difficulty of using social media in their future career. They also recognized the effect of algorithms and social justice issues of accessing technology. This evidence demonstrates the active learning exercises used in this course successfully improved students' digital literacy.

DE Digital skills; employment; serious game; immersion; active learning;
   problem-based learning
AB Digital skills are emerging as one of the basic, transversal competencies that allow learners and professionals to excel in wide areas academically and professionally, along with analytical and critical thinking, entrepreneurial mindsets, the capacity to collaborate across cultures, learning-to learn, and more. The PISA review now includes digital skills among the competencies the achievement levels of which is measures for learners in high school. The importance of digital skills is underscored by the Digital Agenda for Europe and the New Skills for New jobs initiatives, both of which highlight the fact that wide professional activities in broad sectors now require familiarity with digital services. The same initiatives point to the lack of 900K professionals with digital skills in the coming years in Europe. At the same time, youth unemployment in Europe is around 24%. These contradicting observations point to the need of building digital skills among young learners with the objective of easing their transition into the job market and boosting their employability prospects as a result of skill sets that are aligned with industry needs.
   Digital skills are broad and may cover a range of abilities and competencies. Examples include the capacity to use popular software and services that can support professional activities, such as text processors, image processors, spreadsheets, and more. Digital skills may further include the capacity to perform basic financial and economic activities on-line, such as accessing bank services, paying bills, using social media for building a professional network, and more. Other related abilities include a good understanding of an individual's digital footprint, respect for the personal data of others, and respect of intellectual property rights. Project EMPLOY aims at building digital skills among lower secondary education learners for use in professional contexts. The project promotes active, experiential learning design in the context of serious games that immerse learners into scenarios inspired by the world of work, the implementation of which requires the deployment of digital skills. Game-play is problem-based facilitating the development of critical and innovative thinking among learners that allow them to use digital skills creatively for addressing real-life professional challenges.
   Recognizing the importance of supporting educational process, EMPLOY further develops instructor support content for promoting the smooth integration of the EMPLOY active learning methodology and serious game into wider blended learning design. This content is comprised of end-to-end learning activities and how-to videos that involve the EMPLOY serious game. The content reaches beyond the application by suggesting good practices for class collaboration and social learning.
   The EMPLOY serious game is deployed in Greece, Turkey, Estonia, Italy, and France. The project is funded with the support of the ERASMUS+ Program.

AB In the field of education, the prominence of information and communication technology (ICT) tools in supporting learning and teaching has been steadily increasing. To effectively imple- ment digital education, it is essential to foster teachers' digital skills, especially in terms of tool utilisation and content development. The period of school closures during the pandemic and the subsequent transition to online education underscored the importance of participants' digital preparedness. Online education posed many challenges for teachers, students and parents. After overcoming the initial technical obstacles, the methodological renewal of education emerged as a key issue. In the summer of 2022, our team conducted an online questionnaire survey involving 292 educators from nine European countries. Our research aimed to investigate online education during the COVID-19 period, encompaassing its positive and negative aspects, methodological considerations and the impact of online education on traditional classroom education. The research findings show that respondents consider the improvement of participants' digital skills to be the most positive aspect of online education. However, they also highlight that this form of teaching provides limited opportunities to motivate learners and is less effective than face-to-face education. The outcome of this research hold practical implications, particularly in teacher training and in-service teacher training. It draws attention to the specifics of digital/online education and the possibilities of developing digital skills.

AB BACKGROUND: Worldwide educational programs face the challenge how to define and integrate digital competencies in medical education. This article describes the implementation of learning outcomes with respect to digital competencies in the compulsory curriculum at Hannover Medical School (MHH).
   METHODS: An interdisciplinary MHH project group was constituted consisting of physicians and experts in medical informatics and in curriculum development. Over the course of 7 work sessions the group compared different international and national frameworks dealing with digital competencies for physicians. By a consensus driven approach the working group drew up a collection of learning outcomes which were regarded relevant to be incorporated in the curriculum at MHH.
   RESULTS: The analysis of different frameworks indicated that data literacy is a central domain within all viewed preexisting catalogs. During the course of the project group analysis, 57 learning outcomes with respect to digital competencies were identified as necessary to be integrated in the compulsory curriculum. They were divided in 5 main categories: "handling of medical data," "the digital infrastructure of the health system," "scope of application: usage in patient care and in the field of preventive medicine," "medico-legal and ethical basics," and "transformation processes in medicine due to digitalization."
   CONCLUSIONS: The MHH project group concluded that medical students should be taught digital competencies that enable an understanding of underlying functional principles of digital systems rather than their correct utilization. The presented project indicates that a close interdisciplinary collaboration of physicians and medical informaticians can be a promising approach to incorporate digital competencies in the undergraduate medical curriculum.

AB The Information Society in which we find ourselves in, characterized by the widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in almost every area of our lives, requires new skills from people. Many studies speak of teacher training in ICT, the acquisition of these skills and the need to promote initial teacher training in this area This study analyzes the perception of digital competences among students of the Bachelor's Degree in Early Childhood Education at a university teaching classroom based courses (University of Malaga), and in another that offers online courses (International University of La Rioja). To this end, the "Questionnaire for the Study of the Digital Competence of Higher Education Students (CDAES)" was used as an instrument to assess the degree of self-perception of digital competence shown by Education university students. The questionnaire was applied to a sample of 164 students. The results show the degree of digital competence that students have -in comparative terms - in aspects such as technological literacy, information research and processing, critical thinking, problem solving and decision making, communication and collaboration, digital citizenship and creativity and innovation.

AB The accelerated development of Information and Communications Technology has had a profound impact on the education system, both online and offline. In a South East European country such as Serbia, new technologies shape information, communication, and collaboration dynamics while contributing to a persistent digital divide regarding the skills necessary to obtain, process, evaluate, and communicate information. In this article, we explore digital divides between students and teachers in higher education with a focus on tensions surrounding digital literacy and collaboration. We apply Weber's theory of stratification to an empirical case study of the digital divide in higher education in Serbia. We draw upon international indicators, secondary statistical sources, and primary semi-structured interviews with students and teachers in higher education. Through this analysis, we illustrate how forms of stratification intervene when trying to integrate new technologies and technology-oriented practices into the classroom. We consider stratification in terms of the traditional digital divide of access as well as stratification along lines of status, politics, and motivations. We interpret educators' reluctance to adopt new technology as a reaction to the technology's capacity to challenge the educators' legitimacy, expertise, and preferred teaching materials. Students compound this situation with both greater familiarity and yet less focus on source credibility.

AB Digital technologies have transformed the social and, consequently, educational context. Given this situation, it is worth highlighting the importance of promoting digital literacy to actively participate in the society in which it develops. This work analyzes the level of mastery of digital skills of the university students in Ecuador. To do this, a descriptive methodology has been used, based on the survey technique, based on a questionnaire (n = 778). Results reveal how the students give priority to research and information management, presenting difficulties in the development and adaptation of technological materials, as well as in the creation and adaptation of digital content. It even highlights how male university education students claim to have better digital skills, while the same situation is not the case for those others who study Intercultural Bilingual Education. This analysis enables Higher Education institutions to make decisions for planning, developing and acquiring digital skills in the university students of Education in Ecuador, in favor of better teaching professional development.

AB This study carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of a digital literacy programme for primary education students. A quasi-experimental design with repeated measures of assessment was used. The sample consisted of 364 students (206 male and 158 female) from the sixth year of primary education. The students were assessed in their own schools and the sample was divided into two groups: experimental group (N = 190) and control group (N = 174). The assessment was carried out in three sessions: pre-intervention, post-intervention and six-month follow-up. The programme was composed of three sessions aimed at improving digital literacy, as a way of developing a safe and responsible use of the internet. The results obtained after the intervention showed statistically significant differences in the comparison between the two groups. Specifically, the experimental group reached a significantly higher degree of digital literacy (conceptual, procedural and attitudinal) than the control group after passing through the programme.

AB As the information technology (IT) continues being a part of everyone life, or, at least, of everyone being in position to use any device connected to some type of a communication network including mobile networks, it has become extremely critical for a person to become digitally literate. Younger generations receive education in digital literacy education during their schooling, while adults are frequently lacking such competences once they leave formal education and find employment. Public libraries aim to bridge the digital divide and provide access to critical information and activities to anyone interested in acquisition of knowledge and skills for use of IT and use of digital information sources. The purpose of the research conducted in form of a survey was to confirm an important role of public libraries as places of informal and continuing education in digital literacy in an environment different from schools and universities (places of formal education). The research results in this paper show that public libraries are active facilitators and educational partners in introducing digital literacy to their users. In spite of some obstacles, public libraries remain determined to provide access to critical information sources and activities, which would lead to greater proficiency in digital literacy.

AB Digital literacy is often proposed as a means of dealing with the problems apparently caused by 'fake news'. This positioning article considers some of the difficulties with this approach. It argues that fake news is not an isolated phenomenon, but one that needs to be understood in a much broader social, economic and cultural context. It also addresses the practical possibilities and difficulties of teaching in this area. The notion of 'digital literacy' appears to define the phenomenon in technological terms. By contrast, this article suggests that we need a broader notion of media literacy, which is based on critical thinking about the economic, ideological and cultural dimensions of media. Even so, the article suggests, the broader problems that are at the root of the problem of 'fake news' are unlikely to be solved very easily.

AB This paper analyzes the digital gap of Elementary Education teachers in Valle de Sula, Honduras, from the dimensions of digital literacy and its impact on teaching practices in 2022. The investigators employed a mixed approach with a descriptive scope; moreover, they collected the information through various techniques and instruments. Regarding the quantitative approach, the authors used a technological skills test according to the office automation program and a questionnaire survey addressed to professors of the first and second cycle of elementary education in which items referring to instrumental, cognitive, axiological, and attitudinal dimensions were included. As for the qualitative approach, the investigators conducted individual interviews, used focus groups, and applied the observation technique by using a checklist. The results reveal that teachers' competencies in office automation skills are basic, they lack electronic devices and connectivity provided by the State in their educational centers, which is why they resort to the use of their own devices and connectivity. In addition, 40% of educators do not employ teaching-learning strategies using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); hence, it is necessary to develop digital literacy and teacher updating programs to reduce the digital gap and strengthen connectivity, provision of technological resources that favor the application of ICT in education. Finally, the authors recommend creating training programs to improve access to ICTs in education.

AB Prospective teachers must acquire subject-specific digital competencies to design contemporary lessons and to promote digital competencies among students themselves. The DiKoLAN framework (Digital Competencies for Teaching in Science Education) describes basic digital competencies for the teaching profession in the natural sciences precisely for this purpose. In this article, we describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a university course based on DiKoLAN which promotes the digital competencies of science teachers. As an example, the learning module Data Processing in Science Education is presented, and its effectiveness is investigated. For this purpose, we used a questionnaire developed by the Working Group Digital Core Competencies to measure self-efficacy, which can also be used in the future to promote digital competencies among pre-service teachers. The course evaluation showed a positive increase in the students' self-efficacy expectations. Overall, the paper thus contributes to teacher education by using the course as a best-practice example-a blueprint for designing new courses and for implementing a test instrument for a valid evaluation.

AB The pervasive role of digital technologies in adult learning and education (ALE) was a prominent theme throughout the deliberations of the Seventh International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA VII) held June 15-17, 2022 in Morocco. CONFINTEA VII embodied the worldwide interest in digital technologies through the use of a hybrid format with appointed delegates participating both virtually and on site. To highlight the importance of digitalization and digital skills, CONFINTEA VII not only devoted a plenary session to "Adult Learning and Education in Digital Environments," but discussions about the role of digitalization and the need to support adults in developing digital skills also permeated other sessions such as "Preparing Adults for the Future of Work." CONFINTEA VII sessions discussed challenges that vulnerable populations have in accessing digital tools and strategies for providing more equitable acccess and professional development to address this digital divide. This article describes learnings from CONFINTEA VII and related efforts at the national, regional, and local levels to support adult learners' use of digital technologies to develop their literacy, numeracy, and occupational skills and the resources that are critical to those efforts. Also discussed is the need for data, research, and monitoring to understand how digital technologies can be effective in adult learning and education and in preparing adults to embrace a culture of lifelong learning.

PLEs could support this continuous learning necessity. However, the learner should have specific digital skills for PLE development and management. This paper addresses these needed digital skills. Initially, the paper introduces a PLE model to present how the learner uses applications to access and manage resources in order to develop his/her PLE. Then, it describes the stages that the learner follows in order to collect, manage, develop, and share resources as well as communicate and collaborate with others in his/her PLE. Finally, the paper presents the digital skills needed by the learner in order to develop and manage a PLE.

AB This paper discusses digital skills and their role in collaborative distance learning. Collaboration is considered to be one of the most effective, yet challenging, methods of teaching and learning. Many learners avoid collaborative tasks, for different reasons. We believe that the level of digital skills may be a key to understanding their attitude. A study was conducted at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland. The respondents assessed, amongst other items, the level of their own digital skills. Based on this assessment, three groups of students with different skill levels were distinguished. Further analyses showed that students with different level of digital skills vary according to their own experiences in collaborative online learning, but not in terms of views on the phenomenon, technologies used, or computer hardware. Most differences are between the low and high skill groups. However, they are also present between the low and average, and the average and high skill groups. These results contribute to the discussion on the need to individualise the teaching and learning process and highlight the roles of digital competence development for all participants in the learning process.

AB With the digitalisation of education increasing, the relationship between student engagement in Technology-enhanced Learning (TEL) and digital skills has remained largely unexplored. There is a strong consensus that engagement is necessary for students to succeed in school. We hypothesised that students reporting high and low levels of general engagement display differences in terms of their engagement in TEL, and that students' digital skills correlate with their engagement in and disengagement in TEL, which in turn is related to their learning outcomes. We used statistical tests to explore the relationship between the students' (N = 410) general engagement and engagement in TEL, and investigated how digital skills were related to engagement and disengagement in TEL. We found significant correlations between students' digital skills and engagement in TEL, showing that the possession of high levels of digital skill is related to engagement in TEL. Interestingly, digital skills were not related to disengagement. This suggests that students reporting both high and low levels of digital skills disengage to some extent when learning with technologies. We also identified variables reflecting both engagement and disengagement in TEL that predict student performance as measured via final grades, implying that in order to understand and support students who learn with technologies, a broader understanding of the factors influencing engagement and disengagement is key.

AB Scholars have long recognized that reading in digital spaces requires unique skills, strategies, and competencies in comparison to those needed for reading printed text. In recent years, the ubiquity of social media and algorithmically targeted content has radically changed the nature of online reading and meaning making. Technological changes have occurred simultaneously with radically altered sociocultural and sociopolitical contexts. To account for an altered technological and sociocultural landscape, new approaches to teaching digital reading and critical media literacy are needed. Addressing these concerns, this case study detailed a digital reading curriculum designed to be responsive to both the contemporary digital media environment and to students' out-of-school digital literacy practices and contexts. The curriculum was collaboratively designed by five middle-school language arts teachers who participated in a semester-long professional learning group focused on digital reading. Drawing upon sociocultural, asset-based, and culturally relevant philosophies of education, these five teachers designed a unique digital reading curriculum. This study examined the nature of this curriculum. The findings detailed four aspects of the teachers' unit: (1) digital reading instruction situated within students' literate lives; (2) critical instruction regarding systemic features of the internet such as algorithms and clickbait; (3) lessons in which students interrogate socially situated meaning making; and (4) lessons focused on the role of emotions while reading online. The findings have implications for future digital reading and media literacy curricula intended to be responsive to students' funds of knowledge, ever-changing literacy technologies, and new, emergent ways of reading and practicing literacy on the internet.

AB Digital competence is undoubtedly one of the key skills that teaching staff should possess. Currently, there are many theoretical frameworks and ways to measure skills and knowledge related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). This article is an attempt to show the real and declared level of digital skills among future teaching staff. The research was conducted in Poland among 128 students of pedagogical faculties (first-year undergraduate studies). The research used a triangulation of research methods and techniques: diagnostic survey and competency tests related to the use of word processors and spreadsheets, and the level of knowledge about the use of ICT. Competency tests were in accordance with the European Computer Skills Certificate (ECDL) standard. The collected data showed the following: (1) more than half of the students rate their own skills in the use of word processors and spreadsheets, and their overall theoretical knowledge as high or very high; (2) in the case of the real assessment of digital competence, only less than 20% reached the passing threshold in the areas of word processors and theoretical knowledge, with only 1.6% passing in the area of spreadsheets; (3) the declared and actual levels of digital competence were moderately related in the surveyed group; (4) attitudes towards new media, self-assessment of digital skills, and previous learning experience in handling ICT are not predictive factors for ECDL test results.

AB This article reports the results of a research project whose purpose was to understand the form of acquisition of digital literacy by Generation Y. The project goal was to identify how this new generation learns and uses Digital Technologies of Information and Communication (TDIC) in and out of school. It also sought to analyze how the domain of such technologies affects such generation's performance in school. The digital literacy is understood here as a set of skills to read, write and interact with other people, mediated by digital technology devices, whose acquisition by Generation Y occurs at home, still in infancy. A questionnaire about socio-economic and technological development was applied, and the participants (children and adolescents aged 9 to 14) were filmed when performing learning activities in the school computer lab in order to observe what were their technological skills. The results indicated that exposure to early technological equipment makes the acquisition of digital literacy by Generation Y as natural as learning to walk and talk and bring in positive impacts on its school learning.

AB Digital literacy is one of the most important issues that women confront today. Lacking of digital literacy excludes women from lifelong learning and development. Our two-phase, multi-method study attempted to examine how ICT literacy affects women and identifies the key factors that motivate adult females to acquire ICT skills. The first phase identified important theoretical constructs that affect and sustain ICT learning and usage among women, using a qualitative approach based on Social Cognitive and Social Capital Theories. In the second phase, a quantitative study was conducted to validate the research model. Our findings suggest that social capital and learning satisfaction contribute significantly to ICT usage, and that this in turn has a positive impact on the level of well-being.

AB Digital literacy becomes critical nowadays for the digitalization of all countries worldwide. Thailand has been transforming into the digital society. To enter successfully into the digital community, there is the need of enhancing digital literacy for all Thai citizens especially the youths who have already blended their daily life with the internet. Like any literacies, digital literacy requires practicing. Therefore, it is necessary to design and development of training or learning course for anywhere and anytime learning. Moreover, it is challenging to provide the appropriate lesson for each person because they need the different level of digital literacy for their goal. This paper proposes the mobile learning for enhancing digital literacy of Thai youths. Through mobile application, the youth learners feel more comfortable and freedom for their learning. The preference and the performance of students are used for personalization support. The experiment is conducted with 100 primary school students in Chiang Rai province, Thailand. The comparison results of pre-test and post-test reveal that the proposed personalized mobile learning can enhance the learning efficiency of students significantly. At the same time, most of the students have satisfied with the personalization learning in the "satisfy" level.

DE Web literacy curriculum; Web education; "Mobile Technology"; "Teacher"
AB In this paper, we discuss digital literacy and preservice teacher education and reflect on the current state of web-based education and development of digital literacy in teacher education in Slovenia. The literacy context is discussed in the context of the Educational Technology course which is delivered in teacher education. The aim of this course for preservice preprimary and primary classroom teachers is to develop student teachers' digital literacy and prepare them for the efficient integration of ICT into their teaching. This will in turn influence learners' digital literacy and competence for active engagement in the emerging culture of participation. The paper discusses web-based teaching methodology with a focus on instructional design, learning resources and high-order learning outcomes. The affordance of mobile technology fosters ubiquitous learning which has been integrated into the teacher education curriculum. The notion of tools in learning and literacies is discussed in the context of the transition from traditional written culture to digital culture. In integrating mobile learning, three important dimensions converge, underlining the development of digital literacy: the technology dimension of wireless mobile providing instant access, the social dimension and the learning behaviours dimension. A survey was conducted to examine undergraduate student-teachers' attitudes on the application of ubiquitous education and the development of digital literacy through the integration of mobile learning. The results indicate that student-teachers have developed competences in a variety of mobile learning and teaching activities They believe that mobile technology increases connection between learner and teacher but are neutral about the integration of children's social practices from their free time to school environment.

AB The differences in terms of access and ICT skills between different groups in society have created a problem of digital divide. To overcome this problem, informal learning models and strategies are required to achieve a greater impact on the population and that population can develop skills that enhance inclusion in the society knowledge. This work proposes the design of a digital literacy informal environment that aims to set a new educational paradigm approach to encourage different learning communities to uses new ICT that allows them to be more competitive in today's world and thus shorten the digital divide. Finally, a case study is presented. The case study was implemented in the Aguascalientes State, Mexico, in a learning community composed by librarians.

AB The text aims at measuring digital literacy among teachers of the third stage of education in Poland (lower secondary schools). The study was commissioned by the Ministry of National Education and was conducted in 2018 in Poland, and involved a group of 484 teachers. The goal of the research was to present the teachers' knowledge and skills related to digital threats in the areas of the assessment of the reliability of information, sexting, cyberbullying, intellectual property rights, the protection of online images, and protection against malware. Digital literacy (DL) was measured using a knowledge and competence test and a diagnostic survey. The ability to enter the LLL process thanks to the ongoing advancement of ICT increases the online safety of all of the school-related stakeholders. A detailed analysis of the results also revealed that the teachers obtained good results in the test in terms of their knowledge about sexting and image protection but scored poorly regarding copyright and the assessment of the reliability of online information; male teachers know more about the technical aspects of digital safety than female teachers; trainees need particular support in the form of informal and non-formal education.

DE Digital literacy; Social semiotics; Systemic functional linguistics;
   Virtual learning environments
AB In this paper social semiotics, and systemic functional linguistics in particular, are used in order to identify registers of digital literacy in the use of virtual learning environments. The framework of social semiotics provides means to systemize and discuss digital literacy as a linguistic and semiotic issue. The following research question was investigated in the paper: What different registers of digital literacy could be identified when students and teachers communicate and interact in a VLE?
   The research question was answered by. initially, an application of social semiotics to virtual learning environments, and its relation to the knowledge domains of everyday, specialized and reflexive digital literacy. This application was then further developed, using an analysis of a course specific use of a virtual learning environment in a case study. The study identified discrepancies between the digital literacies of teachers. designers and students. These discrepancies mean that a shared semiotic register was sometimes difficult to maintain. The conclusion is that the designers and teachers as co-designers of virtual learning environments need a better understanding of everyday digital literacy in order to design more sufficient learning environments. The paper shows that digital literacy must be considered as a situated practice, and that it concerns functional and communicative competencies rather than acquiring a set of technical skills.

One of the main learning objectives is the development of pupils' digital literacy in the teaching of all subjects. This results in high demands especially for primary school teachers. These teachers should have adequate digital competence to develop their pupils' digital literacy in all subjects taught. To determine concrete requirements and demands for digital competence of primary school teachers, the current state of the curricular documents had to be analysed, which is mainly the Framework Educational Program for Elementary Education. This document is being reviewed by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic. These revisions are intended to redefine the scope and content of education. The vision of these revisions is to provide the competencies needed to be employed in personal, civic and professional life. These competencies include, of course, digital competence. The National Institute for Education has published a document with expected learning outcomes to promote digital literacy. In this context, we became interested in the preparedness current primary school teachers to what extent they are prepared to develop pupils' digital literacy within their mathematics lessons.

AB This paper reports on the results of an online survey about mobile application (app) use for academic purposes, i.e. teaching and research, by Higher Degree Research (HDR) students and academic staff at one of the eight New Zealand universities. Two thirds of the 138 respondents reported they used apps for academic purposes. In teaching, apps were reported to be used as a means to push information to students. In research, apps appeared to be used to self-organise, collaborate with colleagues, store information, and to stay current with research. This paper presents the survey results and discusses implications for personal information management in education context and opportunities for university library services.

AB This paper presents the ERASMUS+ DigiLing project, which aims to teach and improve linguists' and translators' skills and knowledge of digitalisation to prepare them for today's job market. Against this background, it discusses the development of digital competencies and distinguishes them from traditional domain-specific and general competencies. For the purpose of competence acquisition, six online courses have been created which all revolve around the field of 'digital linguistics', including localization in the digital age and post-editing machine translation. We provide an overview of the project, the course contents and the didactic methodology. In addition, we discuss which competencies and skills will be essential for translators who have just graduated and whether, how and to what extent these can be integrated into translator education curricula. Finally, the paper demonstrates how the DigiLing courses can be used to train trainers of translation students so that the former can remain up to date with respect to the job profiles of translators today and going forward.

AB The present study aimed at examining the effect of e-learning and students 'digital literacy towards their learning outcomes. It was designed in quasi-experimental research with post-test-only control group within 2x2 factorial design. The sample of the study involved 96 vocational students obtained from random sampling technique. Two instruments were conducted in this study, namely questionnaire and test. The obtained data were analysed descriptively and inferentially assisted by SPSS 25 in which analysis variance test (ANOVA) was conducted for hypothesis testing. The results of the study show 1) there are different learning outcomes between students who were taught using e-learning and conventional method; 2) there is an interactional effect between e-learning and students' digital literacy; 3) there are different learning outcomes between students with high digital literacy of experimental and high control group; and 4) there are different learning outcomes between students with low digital literacy of experimental and high control group. The provision of e-learning is effective for learning process. It implicates the teachers in which they direct students to know any digital learning platforms. It gives chance to integrate learning and technology to make students familiar with various technology which gives impact to their learning outcomes.

AB The current labor market demands new qualities and knowledge from the recent graduates of universities. This has been called 21st century digital skills' and there is not enough research on the self-perception of students in this regard. The objective of this research was to measure student self-perception about their own 21st century digital skills related to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in Higher Education. A questionnaire was generated and applied to 356 students with the stratified random sampling technique. A principal component analysis was carried out, supported by adequate values of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient and the Bartlett sphericity test. The data indicate that the students use digital technology in academic projects, primarily: they have a lot of skill when using ICT for information management, to develop critical thinking and to solve problems, as well as to manage mobile devices. However, their self-perception in the use of ICT in teaching classes is low. The results suggest that the students do not believe that the use of ICT in the classroom is useful to develop this kind of emerging digital skills. Instead, they think that carrying out academic projects does strengthen the acquisition and development of such skills in relation to the use of ICT.

AB The inclusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in people's daily lives, as well as their influence on the development of multiple professional and personal spheres, has taken on a notorious role for society when it comes to being communicated and informed. This is leading to the creation of numerous jobs that, until a few years ago, did not exist. Because of this, education must respond to the needs and realities that exist today and offer students a quality education. In this way, current education professionals must be trained and updated in order to meet and attend to the needs of students in the new media and digital environment. The objective of this study is to know the degree of digital literacy, as well as the instruments used by English teachers in the Primary Education stage. To this end, research has been carried out using a quantitative methodology with the participation of a total of 112 educators specialising in English from the Community of Madrid, through the creation of a survey. Among the most outstanding results, it can be pointed out that teachers are committed to the use of ICT in their classrooms. However, they present a medium-low training in the subject. In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the level of digital literacy among teaching staff must be as optimal as possible, thus offering a response in accordance with society's demand.

AB The promotion of digital literacy is a priority for most information societies, as they become highly dependent on digital resources. As one of the core requirements of the workplace, digital literacy is increasingly being incorporated in higher education curricula. This paper aims to depict the level of digital literacy of higher education students, based on their own perceptions. The multiplicity of existing definitions for digital literacy constitutes a difficulty in its assessment. Hence, this paper begins by proposing a threefold definition of digital literacy: access to technology, operational competences and conceptual skills. This definition was deconstructed into sets of specific skills that were the subject of an online questionnaire that Portuguese higher education students were asked to complete. The analysis of the students' self-evaluation in terms of their digital literacy, offered an important insight into their specific strengths and weaknesses when it comes to Information and Communication Technology.

AB The remarkable advancements in technology have affected the way people engage, work, and learn. Digital literacy, also known as virtual learning, has the potential to improve lifelong learning. Workplace skills evolve at such a rapid pace that no school system can keep up with the continual need to alter how we work and live. Most crucially, our society's profound changes require young people to acquire new abilities. Malaysia has a long-term vision that calls for sustainable and productivity-driven growth that can only be accomplished with digitally literate employees. Although to some extent Malaysia education system has been initiating, there is very limited research that focuses on what drives digital literacy. There is no proper framework or guidelines that can be used as a blueprint to prepare the young graduates in the 21st-century workforce. The purpose of the study is to examine the drivers of digital literacy that can be taught in higher institutions and apply in today's digital workplace. This research focused on young adults as a unit of analysis and a quantitative method was used to collect the data. A total of 300 young individuals responded through self-administered questionnaires. The finding of the research showed that critical skills, operational skills, visual learning style, collaborative learning style and learning system enhance digital literacy. Finding further recommend that digital literacy improve both academic performance and employability. From this research, solutions can be proposed to both academicians and employers in achieving the digital literate graduates for the 21st-century workforce.

AB In this study, we present research conducted in Peru involving the Beca 18 student population from the Ministry of Education, a social aid program provided by the Peruvian government to high-performing students in the country. The research aims to provide a psychometric approach to the Digital Competency Questionnaire in Higher Education (CDES) for this population, as well as its cross-cultural adaptation. The final sample size is large (N=10842), which allows for the examination and understanding of the relevan-ce associated between the assessment provided by this specific group of higher education students on digital competencies when faced with a prior lack of financial resources. The conditions offer various interpretive readings. Ultimately, it is observed that the instrument is suitable and relevant for specific samples, with validation and cross-cultural translation data being confirmed. Furthermore, very high values of relevance and importance of digital competencies are observed, which are significantly linked to disadvantaged social conditions.

AB Background: Today's medical students are growing up in a digital age in which the use of smartphones and smart devices is now irrevocably part of professional life. However, the abilities to use these devices that have become so ubiquitous in private life can only be partially transferred to work with patients and the medical setting. Since little is known about digitalization in medical education, the aim of this paper is to gain an overview of the current training in digital competencies at Swiss universities.
   Methods: The medical deans at all Swiss universities were contacted by telephone and informed about an online survey. The invitation to fill out the Survey Monkey questionnaire was subsequently sent by email to the specific contacts at each university. The survey consisted of questions to be answered using a defined scale and open-ended questions. The survey's focus, topics involving digital competencies, is based on the content in the Principal Relevant Objectives and Framework for Integrative Learning and Education in Switzerland (PROFILES) and the National Competency-based Catalogue of Learning Objective in Undergraduate Medicine (NKLM).
   Results: All of the dean's offices that were contacted participated in the survey. The topics on digitalization were all rated as relevant or very relevant. Our survey shows a heterogeneous picture in terms of implementing PROFILE and NKLM content. A few universities have well-established educational approaches or even implemented curricula, but often these are still in development. Participants also mentioned factors that are necessary for successfully setting up and implementing curricula dealing with digitalization and factors that can impede such efforts.
   Conclusion: The importance of acquiring digital competencies during medical study is known and recognized by all Swiss medical schools. Curricular integration varies in its progress and represents major challenges for the medical faculties. It is precisely the inclusion of students in such efforts that may be a potential response to this challenge.

AB The scientific production of digital literacy at the university level published in the Scopus database is analyzed, with a special emphasis on studies on tourism due to the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in said professional sector. For this, a bibliometric study of a pertinent sample is undertaken using a mixed methodology and based on a series of variables related to formal and content aspects. The last variable, reserved for the academic field under study, directly addresses the main objective as regards tourism. The results show a great global and multidisciplinary interest in digital literacy (DL), mainly from students. There is also a parallel between the integration of ICT into society and the growing evolution of case studies, as well as little interest in their development in specific areas such as tourism studies. Despite good results in general terms, the lack of specialization poses challenges that require greater involvement of training institutions in the sense of providing future professionals with the necessary tools to face them successfully, especially in sectors such as tourism where ICTs are a key piece.

AB The incorporation of technologies in scenarios of social interaction has led to changes in the way in which people communicate, learn and share information. In education, access and massification of digital infrastructure has led to the need to conceptualize and reconceptualize the term digital literacy from various angles as a way of understanding what are the skills needed to participate in a hyperconnected world. In this work, a systematic review of the bibliography related to the topic was carried out using the Scopus database. A diachronic study was carried out that examined 138 articles obtained from the terms digital literacy, education and school. An early conceptualization based on the need to incorporate skills to use technologies instrumentally was identified, and a contemporary reconceptualization in which the idea that mastering hardware and software is enough to consider a person digitally literate is overcome. It is concluded that, in order to make digital literacy conceptualizations, terms such as information literacy, computer literacy and media literacy must necessarily be considered, since new literacies based on the incorporation of technologies in education are articulated on these parameters.

DE Digital Literacy; Individual/Social Skills; Competences; Responsible Use
AB The phenomenon of digital literacy, or literacies, has been the focus of research for already several decades. However, it is still unclear whether the competence of operating and creating in the virtual reality should be mastered individually or formed with the assistance of academics. Moreover, the integral components of digital literacy are still subject to discussion. These aspects motivated the author to seek the students' understanding of the notion and the degree of responsibility they believe should be applied when using the materials obtained in the internet. As the initial step in the research that is to be developed further, a group of students, as well as a limited group of teachers, were given a discourse literacies test checking their understanding of the notion and conscientious use of online resources. The results confirmed the author's hypothesis that, firstly, definitions of digital literacy vary from person to person, and, secondly, digital competence for both advanced and medium users mostly implies being able to process the data obtained in the digital area and neglecting the skill of being critical and cautious with regard to online resources. Thus, the problem remains to determine who should make young people aware of online etiquette and how it should be done in the context of higher education, if we presume that growing a fully fledged specialist is the responsibility of an educational institution. This constitutes both food for thought and an incentive for further research.

AB This study aims to develop effective strategies for enhancing the digital skills of students specialising in information technology (IT). The study's relevance is justified by the necessity to adjust educational methods to the dynamic development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital technologies in general. The object of the study is students at Astana IT University who are studying IT. The experimental group (EG) trains using IoT-integrated digital educational materials (DEMs), while the control group (CG) receives traditional training. Since existing research often omits the synergy between IoT and educational methods, creating a gap in understanding the effectiveness of integrated educational resources, this study applies research methodology, including literature analysis, experimentation, and statistical data analysis. The research results are verified using statistical methods such as the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and F-test. Analysing the mean scores in the experimental and CGs helps measure students' progress in developing digital skills. The study aims to determine the effectiveness of IoT-integrated DEMs in enhancing students' digital skills and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of these educational approaches on IoT learning. The findings will significantly improve educational programs and methodologies in the IT domain in line with current technological advancements.

AB The use of digital tools has become inherently present in the daily life of a large part of the population. This population is undergoing a marked demographic change with the aging of individuals. This study aimed to compile information about digital literacy in the face of the aging process, investigating the benefits and impacts of literacy in the lives of elderly people. To this end, a bibliographic research of narrative literature review was conducted using databases such as Google Scholar, Scielo, and PubMed. The panorama of literacy in different contexts was presented as a fundamental form of social participation influenced by culture and, with the advance of digital technologies, the importance of the domain and fluency of instruments involved in the virtual world is denoted. Elderly individuals inserted in the dynamics of technology undergo formal and informal learning in literacy, inferring different benefits to well-being and quality of life depending on the specificity of the latter, such as literacy in health that benefits self-care. We conclude that digital literacy positively influences the quality of life of the elderly, and the family support network is an important informal provider of such learning. We also consider reservations about the development and strengthening of the competencies involved in digital literacy, which, in a comprehensive manner, promotes digital and social inclusion and access to the diversity of tools available in the digital environment.

AB Digital literacy is a factor that determines a teacher's technology usage in learning. An interesting situation is found when physical education must be conducted in contemporary style, but on the other hand, it must also be able to incorporate practice in the field. This study aimed to investigate the digital literacy level of physical education teachers. The sample in this study was high school teachers in Bojonegoro Regency, consisting of 12 physical education teachers. The sample selection technique used was total sampling. The type of this research is quantitative using a survey method. Data was collected using a questionnaire via Google Form. After the data were obtained and grouped, they were then analyzed using percentages. The outcome of this research was organized into three categories, respectively the low category of 25.06%, the medium one of 33.34%, and lastly the high category of 41.6%. Young teachers fill the high category in the level of digital technology usage. From the results of the Spearman test, the younger the teacher, the better the level of mastery in technology. The computer literacy of physical education teachers affects their use of technology in delivering learning. Several things are related to one another, namely digital literacy, signals, and internet usage.

AB Much like immigrants who leave the cultural comfort of their home societies and move to places with very different cultures and social practices, those who teach online leave the familiarity of the face-to-face classroom for the uncharted terrain of the online environment, whose constraints and affordances often lead to very different practices. The trans-classroom teacher who moves between the two environments, transferring ideas, strategies, and practices from one to the other, is a mental migrant. The transformations-of the teacher and of the course-that occur in these migrations and the two-way interactions between face-to-face and online teaching are the focus of this study. As teachers adapt their courses for the online environment, they are forced to re-examine the course design, reconsider curriculum strategies, and make many decisions about what to take out and what to keep, what to add and what to substitute. The implication for faculty who would like to implement mobile learning in their online or traditional courses is that they can begin by making content and information available to students in formats easily accessible by mobile phone or laptop computer. This would be a logical first step, since a majority of students and faculty already use these tools in many of their daily activities. Other tools, such as video iPods and MP3 players, can be phased in gradually. The following ideas could be implemented immediately with little to no additional cost. Most basic cell phones today can send and receive text messages, voicemail, and e-mail. E-mail is a convenient way to communicate information to the learning community, so the instructor can begin by sending class-wide "broadcast" e-mails that students can access via a variety of mobile devices

AB Introduction: It is estimated that around 50% of cancer patients require Radiotherapy (RT) at some point during their treatment, hence Therapeutic Radiographers/Radiation Therapists (TR/RTTs) have a key role to play in patient management. It is essential for TR/RTTs to keep abreast with new technologies and continuously develop the digital skills necessary for safe RT practice. The RT profession and education is not regulated at European Union level, which leads to heterogeneity in the skills developed and practised among countries. This study aimed to explore the white and grey literature to collate data on the relevant digital skills required for TR/RTTs practice.Methods: An exhaustive systematic search was conducted to identify literature discussing digital skills of TR/RTTs; relevant grey literature was also identified. A thematic analysis was performed to identify and organise these skills into themes and sub-themes.Results: 195 digital skills were identified, organised in 35 sub-themes and grouped into six main themes: (i) Transversal Digital Skills, (ii) RT Planning Image, (iii) RT Treatment Planning, (iv) RT Treatment Administration, (v) Quality, Safety and Risk Management, and (vi) Management, Education and Research.Conclusion: This list can be used as a reference to close current gaps in knowledge or skills of TR/RTTs while anticipating future needs regarding the rapid development of new technologies (such as Artificial Intelligence or Big Data). Implications for practice: It is imperative to align education with current and future RT practice to ensure that all RT patients receive the best care. Filling the gaps in TR/RTTs skill sets will improve current practice and provide TR/RTTs with the support needed to develop more advanced skills.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Given the current threat posed by toxic digital content, preparing students to evaluate online sources cannot be relegated to a single subject area-this instruction should happen across the curriculum. This article focuses on materials designed to teach students to evaluate online information across subject areas. ninth-grade biology and world geography teachers taught a series of curriculum-embedded lessons based on the following design principles: (a) Focus on a core question and strategy; (b) engage students in evaluating real online content; (c) feature cognitive apprenticeship and formative assessment; and (d) support teacher learning. We examine whether these lessons helped students become more skilled evaluators of online content. Pretest/posttest data (N =574) showed statistically significant growth in students' ability to evaluate the credibility of online content. We analyze the role played by the curriculum design principles in this interdisciplinary intervention and explore implications for future initiatives.

AB The increasing digitalization of medicine stressed the importance of teaching digital competencies in undergraduate medical education. However, in many medical curricula in Germany, medical informatics is underrepresented. Due the upcoming reorganization of medical undergraduate education in Germany, topics previously assigned to medical informatics represent curricular challenges for all medical disciplines. Against this background, experiences from the project DigiWissMed show how medical informatics can support the teaching of digital competencies in all disciplines of medical education. Therefore, interdisciplinary teaching teams of medical informatics professionals and physicians were formed. In different academic years, this teaching teams jointly designed and implemented new seminars to convey digital competencies. The seminars covers topics such as technology acceptance, telemedicine and assistive health care related to the medical specialty. So, in the project DigiWissMed, the practicability and usefulness of interdisciplinary teaching teams to convey digital competencies could be demonstrate. In the digitalization process of medicine, medical informatics plays a key role. For future-proof medical education, experts of this field should be involved in teaching digital competencies, too.

AB University dropout, with its complexity of causes, has become a crucial issue, especially in the context of the pandemic. This study specifically addresses the relationship between the lack of teaching digital skills and dropout at UTESA-Corporate System during the Covid-19 crisis. Adopting an ex post facto approach and an explanatory associative strategy, 322 teachers and 373 dropout students were surveyed. Both groups were selected from broader populations, and surveys with multiple choice questions and Likert scales were administered. The analysis was based on a relational structural model with 9 constructs and 16 hypotheses, supported in part by statistical tools such as SMART-PLS v4.0 and SPSS v29.1. The conclusions highlight that the lack of digital skills in teachers significantly impacts student dropout, attributing this to insufficient training in the use of digital media. This lack contributes to students' low motivation and negative attitude toward the learning process, underscoring the need to strengthen teaching digital skills to improve student retention.

AB Introduction. Data science is becoming increasingly prominent in the medical profession, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting additional challenges and opportunities for medical education. We retrospectively appraised the existing biomedical informatics (BMI) and biostatistics courses taught to students enrolled in a six-year medical program. Methods. An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among 121 students in their fourth year, with regard to the courses they previously attended, in contrast with the ongoing emergency medicine (EM) course during the first semester of the academic year 2020-2021, when all activities went online. The questionnaire included opinion items about courses and self-assessed knowledge, and questions probing into the respondents' familiarity with the basics of data science. Results. Appreciation of the EM course was high, with a median (IQR) score of 9 (7-10) on a scale from 1 to 10. The overall scores for the BMI and biostatistics were 7 (5-9) and 8 (5-9), respectively. These latter scores were strongly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient R = 0.869, p < 0.001). We found no correlation between measured and self-assessed knowledge of data science (R = 0.107, p = 0.246), but the latter was fairly and significantly correlated with the perceived usefulness of the courses. Conclusions. The keystone of this different perception of EM versus data science was the courses' apparent value to the medical profession. The following conclusions could be drawn: (a) objective assessments of residual knowledge of the basics of data science do not necessarily correlate with the students' subjective appraisal and opinion of the field or courses; (b) medical students need to see the explicit connection between interdisciplinary or complementary courses and the medical profession; and (c) courses on information technology and data science would better suit a distributed approach across the medical curriculum.

AB Digital literacy is a significant need in the 21st-century world. Mastery of digital literacy in the context of learning can streamline and improve learning processes and outcomes. Digital literacy is a new life skill currently. This study aims to describe the quality -based management model of elementary schools in enhancing the digital literacy of elementary school teachers in one of the provinces of Central Java, Indonesia. The qualitative approach used involves 10 principals and 20 elementary school teachers. The instruments used are observation, interview, and questionnaires. The analytical technique used Miles and Huberman's analysis. Based on the results of this study, there is an increase in teacher digital literacy after education quality management is implemented through a teacher digital literacy training program that is designed continually. Forms of participation include involvement in teacher digital literacy training program activities, namely training program planning (Plan), implementation of teacher digital literacy training programs in schools (Do), implementation of supervisory functions, monitoring and evaluation of digital literacy training programs (Check), and follow-up actions. continued teacher digital literacy training program (Action). Teachers' digital literacy on the basic level improves from 62.74% to 84.74%. The secondary level turns 51.33% from 45.56%. This research can be an attempt to improve teachers' digital literacy.

AB In the generation of those born in a digital environment, devices are understood as something natural in the way of obtaining instant information. The educational system has adapted and developed new pedagogical models, to combine teaching with the intrinsic characteristics of digital students. In this scenario, meaningful learning provides the educational system with an active model that allows the student to associate the new information with the one they already have, readjusting and rebuilding both in the process. In this context, new technologies act as mediating tools for learning, favoring pedagogical practices in teacher-student relationships. The application of Information and Communication Technologies promote the acquisition of abilities, skills and knowledge for its subsequent professional and social application. Thus, the objective of the study was to identify the scientific publications related to significant learning and the technologies applied in higher education during the period 2000 to 2019. A bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature was carried out. For this, 1,161 documents on this topic were identified. The results of the analysis revealed that scientific productivity has increased since 2010, verifying the deep interest in new technological resources applied to teaching. The main research trends include the impact on students' cognitive processes, motivations, and academic performance.

AB With rapid development of scientific technology, digital technology has appeared frequently in the public, while digital literacy wins more attention for being the necessary skills in the new age. It is the trend that digital literacy based teaching resources from advanced schools will enter into English teaching classes. MOOC and Flipped Classroom are important methods of English teaching mode reform in advanced schools. Under the background of new age, the requirement for talents will be stricter, which will cause most students cultivated from current foreign language teaching mode in advanced schools cannot meet the standards of social development. In order to improve comprehensive capacity of students from advanced schools, through elaborating digital literacy, the paper proposes the research on advanced schools foreign language teaching method reform under digital literacy perspective to ensure advanced school students can adapt sustainable and healthy social demands in new age.

AB Many universities have wellness programs to promote overall health and well-being. Using students' own personal data as part of improving their own wellness would seem to be a natural fit given that most university students are already data and information literate. In this work, we aim to show how the interplay between health literacy and data literacy can be used and taught together. The method we use is the development and delivery of the FLOURISH module, an accredited, online-only but extra-curricular course that delivers practical tips in the areas that impact students' everyday wellness including sleep, nutrition, work habits, procrastination, relationships with others, physical activity, positive psychology, critical thinking, and more. For most of these topics, students gather personal data related to the topic and submit an analysis of their data for assessment thus demonstrating how students can use their personal data for their benefit. More than 350 students have taken the module and an analysis of the use of online resources, as well as feedback on the module experience, are presented. The contributions of this article are to further endorse the need for health literacy and digital literacy for students, and we demonstrate that these can be taught together making each literacy more appealing to the digital natives of Generation Z who make up the majority of students. The implications for public health research and practice are that two student literacies, health and digital, are not independent and for our students, they should be taught together.

AB The growing prominence of the Internet, and other digital environments, as educational tools requires research regarding learners' digital literacy. We argue that two critical aspects of digital literacy are the ability to effectively plan and monitor the efficacy of strategies used to search and manage the wealth of information available online, and the knowledge to appropriately vet and integrate those information sources. Therefore, digital literacy requires effective self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, and availing epistemic cognition (EC). Although numerous researchers and scholars have examined the role of SRL in online learning (e.g., Efklides, 2011; Lee & Tsai, 2010; Williams & Hellman, 2004; Winters, Greene, & Costich, 2008), there is a need for additional empirical research on how SRL and EC interact, and relate to learning in digital environments. In this study, we used a powerful, but little-used data collection methodology, think-aloud protocol (TAP) analysis, to investigate the relations among SRL, EC, and learning gains with 20 college students who studied vitamins on the Internet. We also contributed to the literature by exploring alternative techniques for preparing, analyzing, and representing these data, accounting for the strengths and challenges of TAPs. We found that, on average, participants did increase their understanding as a result of learning with the Internet, and that a data-driven approach to understanding relations among SRL, EC, and learning yielded the most powerful representation of these phenomena. Our study has implications for future research on digital literacy using TAPs, as well as the relative contribution of SRL and EC, as aspects of digital literacy, to online learning.

AB To transform an organization, it isn't possible to ignore the people aspect and the significant impact of talent development in any transformation process. While in larger organizations, there is often access to more resources that ultimately could bring the needed competencies to successfully run such a complex program, in small or medium enterprises, the resources are more limited and the access to talent more difficult, forcing a potential more aggressive strategy in developing the digital skills needed to enable their transformation. This work aims to review some of the literature and better comprehend the role of learning analytics as a practice that could potentially be used to enhance the learning process within Small and Medium Enterprises and support the improvement of digital literacy within these companies.

AB As students transition into tertiary blended learning environments, their digital literacy in terms of technical capabilities have potential to impact on their access to digital resources. The first foundational year of STEM degrees includes compulsory courses across a broad range of scientific areas, each of which incorporates online technology in a discipline-specific manner. Given the diversity of online resources that STEM students need to access across their first-year coursework, this study applies learning analytical methods to determine whether students' perceived level of digital literacy has an effect on their navigation of learning management systems (LMS) and overall academic performance. The frequency and nature of LMS interactivity were examined across four first-year STEM courses offered in the same semester at a single institution, using a K-means cluster analysis to group student responses. It was observed that high achieving students accessed LMS resources more frequently than mid or low-achieving students across all four STEM courses. Students' perceived level of digital literacy was collected via survey (n = 282), and students were sorted high (n = 106) and low-level (n = 176) of perceived digital literacy-HDL and LDL, respectively. HDL students were not consistently found in the high-achieving academic group and did not perform better in their overall grade when compared to LDL students. LDL students were observed to perform better in specific online assessment tasks, which may be attributed to their increased frequency of LMS interactivity. These findings highlight the delicate balance between students' perceived level of digital literacy, motivation for engaging with online learning environments, and academic performance.

AB Digital literacy is a media based learning that combines education and technology with the hope that students can make the most of it. This requires learning skills, one of which is the ability to take the initiative to be responsible for learning materials, often called self-directed learning. The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of self-directed learning on students' level of digital literacy in online learning. This study used a quantitative approach with ex-post facto research type. The populations in this study were students of the University of Lampung with a sample of 947 taken using simple random sampling. The data collection instrument used was adapted from the Self Rating Scale of Self-Directed Learning (SRSSDL) and Digital Literacy Measurement (DLM). The data collected were analyzed using linear regression. The results showed the positive and significant effect of self-directed learning on the digital literacy level of students, with the contribution of 54.80%, and the rest was influenced by other factors that were not measured in this study. The effect also had a positive direction, which means that the higher the student's self-directed learning score, the better the digital literacy skills will be.

AB The use of digital technologies in developing the four language skills in English classrooms has not been sufficiently researched. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital technology and digital literacy in teaching and learning English. This study aims to firstly investigate the applications of digital technology and the level of digital literacy in learning and teaching English. Secondly, to measure the significant differences between EFL teachers and students in their usage of technology and digital literacies in English classrooms. Two questionnaires were distributed to 150 students and 40 teachers. The data were analyzed descriptively using SPSS 23.0. The findings show that students' use of digital technology was the highest in learning vocabularies and lowest in reading skills, while teachers' highest use was for general teaching practices and lowest for reading skills. Participants have high digital literacies. The findings supported the null hypotheses related to the significant difference between usage of digital technology for language pedagogy. These findings offer implications for policymakers towards designing plans to integrate digital technologies in the language classrooms of marginalized societies such as B40 in Malaysia.

AB Understanding the connections between scientific inquiry and digital literacy in informal learning environments is essential to furthering students' critical thinking and technology skills. The Habitat Tracker project combines a standards-based curriculum focused on the nature of science with an integrated system of online and mobile computing technologies designed to help students learn about and participate in scientific inquiry in formal classroom settings and informal learning environments such as science museums or wildlife centers. This research documents the digital literacy skills elementary students used while participating in the Habitat Tracker project, exploring the connections between the scientific inquiry practices they developed and the digital literacy skills they employed as they engaged with the Habitat Tracker curriculum. The results of this research have implications for researchers and practitioners interested in fostering both the scientific inquiry practices and digital literacy skills of elementary students in formal and informal learning environments.

AB Drawing from critical disability studies and cultural studies, this article unpacks cultural understandings of digital abilities. We analyse policy documents on digital education as cultural texts which communicate cultural values. Methodologically, we understand policy ideas as deriving from the larger culture. Our analysis first explores how abilities are connected to economic growth, as well as what kind of history of ideas frames this presumption. Second, it explores the assumption of constantly changing technologies and the workers who must adapt themselves to such a situation. Third, the article interrogates citizenship as a cultural idea within the current policy ideas about digital skills. Our account offers new perspectives on the analysis of biocapitalism and provides a specific analysis of how able-mindedness is foregrounded in digital education. It argues that digitalisation, as a policy matter, intensifies discourses emphasising the development of abilities and that this social tendency is neither value neutral nor necessary.

AB The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are one of the many components of the personal learning environment (PLE). These tools have been gaining importance, especially the ones related to the Web 2.0, which allow the users a more active role in the search of information, the creation of new contents when sharing this information to other people. The concept PLE is not only related to the tools, but also the activities and connections that a person uses to improve learning skills [1], transforming the digital skills in an allied for the development of PLE.
   The objective of the present work is to analyze the PLE of the education senior students in careers related to the Centro de Investigacion y Docencia en Educacion (CIDE) from the Universidad Nacional (Costa Rica). From an analytical empirical paradigm, specifically an ex post facto and transversal design [2]. The data is collected with an ad hoc questionnaire composed of different blocks, that measures the general aspects, for example, the previous training in technology, as well as each of the components extracted from the theoretical construct that defines the PLE [3]. The final sample (n=381) was selected in a probabilistic manner by strata, considering each academic unit belonging to the CIDE as a stratum.
   The PLE remains defined by each person according to their interests [4], however, the results show how those of the collective object of this study are poorly developed. The students show a high ignorance of certain tools, especially web 2.0. When looking for information, the student uses generic resources, which does not allow them to manage and retrieve information quickly and easily. It is observed how the most used tools to generate content are desktop, limiting the possibilities offered by web 2.0, coinciding with other research ([5],[6]), showing few skills in the use of technological resources.
   The findings show how the student generates activities related especially to the search for information and organization of the same, coinciding with the findings of [7] by indicating that the study environments are especially focused on the recovery of information and not so much in the creation of content. Equally, it can be observed as social networks. This finding may influence poorly developed PLE [8], since they are nourished with collaborative learning, especially with staff learning network (PLN).

AB The digital divide excludes more people every day, becoming a new form of social exclusion, impeding the development of countries and progress towards a more equitable society. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program that allows the development of digital skills in students at High School Basic Education. A quasi-experimental methodology is followed with repeated evaluation measures in three control groups and three experimental groups. The selection of the groups was carried out through an intentional non-probability sampling, reaching a participation of 204 students, of which 55.9% were male and 44.1% were female from 11 to 19 years old (M = 14.1; SD = 2.24). The assessment was conducted using the ECODIES instrument at their educational institution. After confirming the data non-normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), non-parametric descriptive and inferential analyses were performed (Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test), as well as the effect size calculation using Cohen's d. The results showed the existence of statistically significant differences in the experimental groups before and after the application of the program, unlike the control groups. This indicates that the students of the experimental groups achieved a higher degree of digital literacy than the control group after their participation in the intervention. It is concluded that the training programs that seek the development of digital skills integrated into the school curriculum positively influence the degree of ICT literacy of the educational and contributes to the divide.

AB Digital literacy is recognized as a fundamental skill integrated into the capabilities of the modern student to learn effectively in a digital environment, with new languages, ways of communicating and unknown environments that require new skills and abilities. The implementation of literacy and the development of necessary technological skills in students form a key part of digital inclusion, which is why research has been originated with the purpose of diagnosing both basic skills and digital literacy to determine, among others, the existence of gaps. The objective of this study is focused on determining the most competent instruments in the diagnosis of skills, for which, as a Method, a systematic search and review of the literature has been carried out, linked to instruments for measuring competences and digital literacy, to identify categories, level of knowledge and skills to function safely in the virtual space. The results delimited 24 publications considered in the systematic review, whose analysis considered the design, validation and application of a competency diagnosis instrument, including the comparison of the models of consultations carried out, to collect the most relevant indicators. The conclusions indicate that the studies carried out in the classroom are slow, but effective, to manage and transfer an objective vision of the diagnosis, but the cost and time justify carrying out self-applied surveys, self-reports and self-assessments, just as plausible, making it possible to deploy numerous students. questions, problems and developments, on a wide range of digital skills in a short time and online.

AB BackgroundBeing digitally literate allows health-based science students to access reliable, up-to-date information efficiently and expands the capacity for continuous learning. Digital literacy facilitates effective communication and collaboration among other healthcare providers. It helps to navigate the ethical implications of using digital technologies and aids the use of digital tools in managing healthcare processes. Our aim in this study is to determine the digital literacy level and awareness of our students receiving health-based education in our university and to pave the way for supporting the current curriculum with courses on digital literacy when necessary.MethodStudents from Acibadem University who were registered undergraduate education for at least four years of health-based education, School of Medicine, Nutrition and Dietetics, Nursing, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology, and Genetics were included. The questionnaire consisted of 24 queries evaluating digital literacy in 7 fields: software and multimedia, hardware and technical problem solving, network and communication/collaboration, ethics, security, artificial intelligence (A.I.), and interest/knowledge. Two student groups representing all departments were invited for interviews according to the Delphi method.ResultsThe survey was completed by 476 students. Female students had less computer knowledge and previous coding education. Spearman correlation test showed that there were weak positive correlations between the years and the "software and multimedia," "ethics," "interest and knowledge" domains, and the average score. The students from Nursing scored lowest in the query after those from the Nutrition and Dietetics department. The highest scores were obtained by Biomedical Engineering students, followed by the School of Medicine. Participants scored the highest in "network" and "A.I." and lowest in "interest-knowledge" domains.ConclusionIt is necessary to define the level of computer skills who start health-based education and shape the curriculum by determining which domains are weak. Creating an educational environment that fosters females' digital knowledge is recommended. Elective courses across faculties may be offered to enable students to progress and discuss various digital literacy topics. The extent to which students benefit from the digital literacy-supported curriculum may be evaluated. Thus, health-based university students are encouraged to acquire the computer skills required by today's clinical settings.RegistrationThis study was approved by Acibadem University and Acibadem Healthcare Institutions Medical Research Ethics Committee (ATADEK) (11 November 2022, ATADEK registration: 2022-17-138) All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

AB The author based her paper on the digital transformation of marketing practice and in relation to it, she points out to the need for adequate preparation of marketing professionals. In this context, she identifies the necessity of digital (digital and media) literacy, which can be formed within education (also at universities). In the wider context of media literacy, she emphasizes exceeding required digital competences in terms of, know-how" with digital technologies in marketing. In addition to their technical dimension and purely instrumental understanding as a mere marketing tool, she emphasizes the need for a critical aspect of digital literacy that is open to ethical, resp. ethical and social perspective, as well as the need for ethical literacy, which refers to the claim of ethical decision-making and behavior of marketing professionals. From this perspective, media and ethical education can be, according to the author, mutually interlinked. Furthermore, the author points out that education, respectively, teaching and learning about digital media should be, in the preparation of marketing professionals, tied to professional, specialized authentic tasks. However, these should not be just experiential method, practicism and purely productively-based teaching and learning strategies. In her opinion, a contribution is a multi-strategic, resp. a pluralistic approach (within the methods themselves) in which complementary, receptive and productive teaching and learning would be applied. This should include both practical and reflective-interpretive and evaluative teaching and learning about digital media in a humanistic perspective.

AB This article reports on a two-year, funded, qualitative inquiry into the challenges and possibilities of integrating video production into pre-service teacher education as a critical digital literacy practice. This includes the skills, knowledge, and dispositions that lead to ability to critique and create digital texts that interrogate the self, the other, and the world (Avila & Zacher Pandya, 2013). Video making holds out enormous potential given our increasingly diverse classrooms and the growing need to have students connect and collaborate within their own communities and globally (Dwyer, 2016; Ontario Ministry of Education, 2015, 2016; Spires, Paul, Nimes, & Yuan, 2018; Watt, 2017, 2018; Watt, Abdulqadir, Siyad, & Hujaleh, 2019). Video is especially significant in light of the fact that it is replacing print text as a dominant mode of communication (Manjou, 2018). Multimodal composing such as video production is, in fact, considered by some to be the essential 21st century literacy (Miller & McVee, 2012), but much remains to be done to bring digital technologies as literacy into the elementary classroom. Qualitative data includes a focus group, questionnaires, observations, and content analysis of teacher candidate videos and instructional plans. This study considers how video production can be integrated into teacher education programs to engage cross-curricular expectations and critical digital literacy perspectives. It responds to the pressing question of how to do teacher education differently in the digital age.

DT Editorial Material
DE Digital literacy; media education; digital education; digital capitalism
AB Advocates of digital education have increasingly recognized the need for young people to acquire digital media literacy. However, this idea is often seen in instrumental terms, and is rarely implemented in any coherent or comprehensive way. This paper suggests that we need to move beyond a binary view of digital media as offering risks and opportunities for young people, and the narrow ideas of digital skills and internet safety to which it gives rise. The article propose that we should take a broader and more critical approach to the rise of 'digital capitalism', and to the ubiquity of digital media in everyday life. In this sense, the paper argue that the well-established conceptual framework and pedagogical strategies of media education can and should be extended to meet the new challenges posed by digital and social media.
   This article presents some reflections as an epigraph of the special issue "Digital learning: distraction or default for the future", whose final result has allowed us to group a set of critical research and analysis on the inclusion of digital technologies in educational contexts. The points of view presented in this epigraph is also developed in more detail in the book "The Media Education Manifesto" (Buckingham, 2019).

AB This article presents an exploratory study undertaken during the initial phase of the Adults Digital Literacy Project (LIDIA), aimed at identifying situations where adults are hindered from exercising their full citizenship, due to their lack of digital technologies knowledge. Within the framework of an action-research methodology, a questionnaire was applied to 106 adults, aged between 26 and 92 years, resident in Portugal. From the data analysis, it was possible to establish 13 categories of needs within the scope of digital literacy of adults, including a set of references stating their desire to handle their bureaucratic issues via the Internet. These results constitute the basis for the proposal of a set of activities with digital technologies, geared towards promoting digital citizenship, around six broad learning areas: 1) information; 2) communication; 3) production; 4) leisure; 5) daily tasks; and 6) and digital identity security - the latter, considered to have a cross-cutting nature and therefore should be considered integrated in one or several domains of learning.

AB This paper reports the findings of a project "Digital Futures in Teacher Education" (DeFT) undertaken as part of the third phase of the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) UK Open Educational Resources (OER) programme. It builds on previous work (Gruszczynska & Pountney, 2012) that has addressed attempts to embed OER practice within the teacher education sector, and that which has informed practice in teaching and learning in the school system involving digital literacy (Burnett & Merchant, 2011; Davies & Merchant, 2009). It examines the effectiveness of a methodology that prizes reflexivity and participation, and includes a range of voices, including children's voices, in the meaning-making process. The paper also offers some recommendations on the basis of early findings of the project. Importantly, the paper offers a framework for digital literacy, drawing heavily on socio-cultural models of digital practice (Merchant, 2011), which have the potential to enhance the teacher (and teaching) while being inclusive of the learner (and learning) and which address the 'why' as well as the 'how' of digital literacy. This framework takes into account, current debates (primarily within UK) focusing on issues of ICT, digital literacy and media literacy in the curriculum, which reflect a tension between of digital literacy as a set of skills and competencies as opposed to understandings that focus more on socio-cultural and communicative practices. This framework builds upon data collected in the context of the project and incorporates meanings and perspectives on digital literacies as expressed by project participants.

AB Purpose Digital literacy has become a widely studied topic for connecting people, participation in government and public affairs. It encourages library professionals to train students and effectively acquire, preserve and disseminate knowledge. Academic libraries involve using digital technology improved the students' level of digital literacy and technological skills. This paper aims to understand the students' technological competence in using database resources and searching for online information. In addition, to evaluate the training contents and designated instructors on digital literacy education, the study also focuses on digitally exposed students' learning behavior, the library management and students' academic interaction on new technological trends. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a quantitative method for which primary data were collected from university students using a structured research questionnaire. Through targeted random sampling techniques, 1,500 printed questionnaires were distributed among students, and 1,266 (84.4%) responses were received. The authors applied descriptive statistics to analyze the demographic information of male and female students. The statistical technique Chi-square test (chi(2)) was applied using SPSS to determine the association between variables. Moreover, Bonferroni correction for the new a value [modified = 0.05/number of possible comparisons/analysis for each question shown in Tables (II-IX)] was also used to avoid a family-wise error. Findings The results inferred a strong association between students' technological skill with using digital tools, utilization of database resources and browsing networked information on the Web. The association between universities in terms of recruiting designated instructors on digital literacy education, introducing ICT based curriculum and the association between library management in maintaining a regular training program on digital literacy demonstrated a negative association. Besides, the findings disclosed that student's digital exposure is not the forcing factor in developing technological competence, but found to be a more encouraging factor. It was also concluded that library technological involvement significantly improves student technology-based learning skills. Practical implications - The results obtained after the analyzed data may help library management in providing long-term strategy for improving digital literacy education and training for students in the effective utilization of technology for better academic performance and social integration. Originality/value The study was based on quantitative methods using a questionnaire. Extensive database coverage and digital literacy skills based on coach input can improve student performance and academic quality.

ID STRATEGY
AB In the swiftly evolving realm of education, digital learning has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing how learners and educators interact with knowledge. This paper delves into the intricate interplay between digital learning abilities, instructional design, and learner support, particularly within the context of blended learning, where traditional educational paradigms merge with technological advancements. Blended learning, the fusion of in-person and digital instruction, necessitates a delicate equilibrium to unleash its full potential. We explore the multifaceted attributes that underpin self-regulation within these environments, such as authenticity, personalization, and scaffolding. Moreover, we investigate how blended learning's effectiveness transcends various educational domains, from vocational schools to mathematics education and entrepreneurship training. The paper underscores the significance of comprehensive learner support and skillful instructional design. It highlights the symbiotic relationship between blended learning and the cultivation of digital literacy, encompassing not just technical prowess but also critical thinking and purposeful digital engagement. As educators embrace these insights, they stand poised to create dynamic educational experiences that empower students for the digital age.

AB The 'Study with Me' learning technique is a new Z-generation online learning approach that has gained popularity. Still, there is a lack of understanding regarding the characteristics of its using learners. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of 'Study with Me' learners and investigate how their motivational orientations influence their learning situations (learning time, learning place), learning competencies, and digital literacy. A survey was conducted with 384 'Study with Me' learners, categorized into three groups based on their motivational orientations: goal-oriented, learner-oriented, and activity-oriented. The results showed that most learners were goal-oriented, and there were significant differences in learning competency and digital literacy among the three groups, with the learner-oriented group having the highest levels. Goal-oriented learners' learning time is the longest. This study confirmed the differential use patterns of 'Study with Me' according to learning motivation. These findings can inform the design of new learning approaches and support services to improve learners' outcomes using the 'Study with Me' learning technique.

AB This study reports preliminary overview on the possibilities of utilizing social media in Indonesian out-of-class language learning, mainly focusing on exploring how university students define the kinds of social media and examining the potential uses of social media to be promoted. The study employed a small-scale survey to students in three different classes in Bandung. The results of the study were that 1) autonomous learning is relatively an exclusive mode of learning in that only some noteworthy students have been internally aware to reflect on how they should learn autonomously and utilize low-cost digital sources to enhance their learning, but have not been able to evaluate their strategies in enhancing their autonomous learning, which further indicates the need for external guidance; 2) social media defined by female students were mostly on the mainstream instant-messaging platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp, while some other students, mostly males, favor the use of online games and social networking platforms in their free time to assist their language learning; and, 3) majority of the students positively perceive social media in providing learning environment beyond its normal use, including female students focusing on utilizing English in their social platforms and male students actively engaging in online English language PC/Android games, though some students are against the use of it due to the lack of formal language engagement.

ID LANGUAGE LEARNERS; ENGLISH; MULTILITERACIES
AB Globalization and digitization have reshaped the communication landscape, affecting how and with whom we communicate, and deeply altering the terrain of language and literacy education. As children in urban contexts become socialized into communities of increasing cultural and communicational connectivity, complexity, and convergence (Jenkins, 2004), and funding for specialist second language (L2) support declines, classrooms have become linguistically heterogeneous spaces where every teacher is a teacher of L2 learners.
   This article has two purposes: The first is to give an overview of the concept of multimodal literacies, which utilize diverse media to represent visual, audio, gestural, spatial, and tactile dimensions of communication in addition to traditional written and oral forms (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009a). Since the New London Group's manifesto on multiliteracies in 1996, which merged language and literacy education agendas in L2 teaching, language arts, media literacy, and cultural studies, new basics have developed that apply to all classrooms and all learners. Second, this article reviews and reports on innovative pedagogical approaches to multimodal literacies involving L2 learners. These are grounded theoretically (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009a, 2009b; Kress, 2003, 2010; New London Group, 1996) and epistemologically (de Castell & Jenson, 2003; Gee, 2009, 2010; Kellner, 2004; Lankshear & Knobel, 2003, 2006).

TI Skill versus Social Practice? Some Challenges in Teaching Digital
   Literacy in the University Classroom
SO TESOL QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Digital literacy is viewed by many governments as an educational priority area, resulting in policies and curricula aimed at developing students' digital literacy skills. This can present many challenges, including lacking teacher professional development, uneven digital infrastructure across school districts or unequal access to digital media among students. In this article, I focus on a different challenge that stems from differing definitions of digital literacy among educational researchers, teachers, and educational policy makers and the tensions that can arise from these differences for teachers who are tasked with developing learners' digital literacy. Specifically, I discuss how I have merged a curricular mandate for a skills-heavy digital literacy policy with my theoretical conviction of literacy as social practice in my teaching of a tertiary course on digital literacy. To do so, I first critically examine Singapore's recent digital literacy curriculum reform with reference to a larger divide between conceptualizations of digital literacy as technical, decontextualized skills related to employability on the one hand and as social practice rooted in students' lived experiences on the other. Second, I discuss my efforts at combining these two perspectives in teaching digital media literacy, highlighting how we can foster digital 'skills' and critical engagement with digital media while providing space for playful and creative communicative practice.

DE Digital skills; informal learning; mobile devices; higher education
AB The purpose of this article is to explore the perception of university students about the development of digital skills in informal educational contexts. To this end, a sequential mixed research was conducted with university students from a private institution in the city of Cali, Colombia. The data collection techniques consisted of an electronic questionnaire and two discussion groups. Among the main results, it was found that students have a heterogeneous perception regarding the development of the different areas of digital skills, being stronger those related to the interaction and the creation/edition of graphic content. The lowest values were reported for security competencies and problem solving. The students referred a wide number of digital practices that they had learned autonomously, through interaction with other individuals, with web resources and from trial-error personal experiences. However, these competences are not usually transferred to the academic field. Finally, some proposals are presented. They can be considered as articulating axes for the development of digital competences inside and outside the classroom.

AB This study aimed to scrutinize the correlation between English as a foreign language (EFL) lecturers' digital literacy competence (DLC) based on the TPACK-SAMR framework and their technostress. In addition, this study revealed how the variables correlated to the lecturers' EFL teaching performances. Therefore, a correlational design with a descriptive explanation model was conducted. The participants were six EFL lecturers from six different universities in various cities in East Java Province, Indonesia. The data were collected by administering TPACK-SAMR DLC and technostress questionnaires, conducting a semi-structured interview, and documenting the teaching scenarios. The results showed that most participants were more confident with their pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge. They claimed it was hard to mingle them into harmonious teaching performances with technology that challenged them to achieve the higher TPACK-SAMR DLC level. Relevant to this finding, their DLC had a negative 'very high' correlation with technostress, shown by -.824 Pearson correlation coefficient. Henceforth, their EFL teaching performances reflected the minimum operation of technology, according to SAMR stages, to mediate EFL teaching by substituting and augmenting the technology. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of DLC training to escalate the positive outcomes of EFL teaching with technology and minimize technostress.

AB This paper explored the level of Digital Literacy (DL) skills for learning among students in two selected public universities in Tanzania. Case study design was used to compare University of Dar es Salaam-UDSM and Sokoine University of Agriculture-SUA as two cases purposively selected. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select a total of 646 students where 325 students were from UDSM and 321 from SUA. The collected data were analysed using a combination of qualitative and descriptive approaches. The findings show that, students in the selected universities have some deficiencies in digital literacy skills for learning. Further, a slight variation exists between students of different programmes, indicating that, all students are predisposed to similar conditions for DL skills acquisition. Gender-wise, the paper indicates a closing gender gap in terms of technology acceptance and DL skills between male and female students. Furthermore, students in lower classes manifested higher skills compared to majority in higher classes on certain DL dimensions, suggesting that, one's advancement to higher academic year does not necessarily translate into increased DL skills. This article recommends the need for a systemic and coordinated support to promote skills that enable students' learning with ICT tools and internet.

AB Digital literacy is a critical element of multiliteracy framework required to thrive in digital era and perceived as cross-curricular competencies, yet it is not adequately addressed in English language teaching. This paper explores the traits of the authentic academic digital practices in the course outlines of English language skills conducive for digital literacy development, examines the extent to which digital literacy are infused in the authentic academic digital practices of the English courses and proposes the procedure of infusing digital literacy in the authentic academic digital practices of English language teaching. The study employs content analysis to address the data-the traits of authentic academic digital practices in fifty-five course outlines of English language skills subjects from six English Language Education and English Literature Study Programs in Jakarta and West Java. The findings recognize the traits of authentic academic digital practices in the digital academic products, such as the answers to open-/closed-ended questions, essays, presentation slides, papers, videos, podcasts, recorded audio-visual presentations, and reports diversely used across the courses. These digital academic products are used merely as the media in which English is used; only English proficiency is highlighted. The underpinning digital competencies to create the media, the media creation process and the media as digital academic products are not sufficiently addressed and measured. Digital literacy is infused in the authentic academic digital practices of English language teaching through five stages of identifying the components of digital literacies and the authentic academic digital practices and products, analysing the descriptors of digital literacies components pertaining to authentic academic digital practices and products, integrating the descriptors of digital literacies into learning outcomes, embedding digital literacies into academic products, employing authentic academic digital practices in the learning process, and assessing digital literacies as cross-curricular competencies.

AB The current Indian education system promotes competition among students, emphasizing highly on ranks and marks scored. As a consequence, students tend to drift away from a collaborative mindset to a competitive one. The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result, a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge, the internet, causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed, we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.

AB Digital literacy skills are essential for today's citizens. These skills are expected for everyday personal use, learning and effective performance at work. The UK's Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (HE) and employers therefore require graduates to be able to demonstrate these skills. However, the cost of UK university education is rising substantially and cash- and time-poor learners must decide what to prioritise. In this context they may favour subject-specific learning rather than skills development. How therefore can we engage learners in developing their digital literacy? The UK's Open University is a distance learning institution. Its Faculty of Health & Social Care (FH&SC) has evolved different approaches for digital literacy skills development using technology-enhanced learning, based on skills resources that are either generic (usable by any FH&SC module) or are context-dependent and module-specific. Our Evaluating Approaches to Developing Digital Literacy Skills (EADDLS) project is exploring learner experiences of digital literacy skills development to identify their needs and preferences, to inform how we can optimise learning designs to better engage and support learners. Furthermore, since skills activities are widely required across different programmes, there is keen interest in the pedagogical and resourcing implications of using generic activities, as opposed to module-specific activities that are more challenging to share and maintain. We therefore also explore the influence of design features such as generic or module-specific contexts. We gathered data from online questionnaires (n=298) and interviews (n=18) involving learners from three modules. Focusing on the qualitative interview data, we explore what learners value and why, including links between attitude, motivation, and preferred learning designs. We identify reasons for certain findings from our quantitative data, e. g. a preference for integrated, module-specific activities over separate, generic activities and suggest a framework for managing activity complexity based on familiarity with the skill and the context.

The peculiarities of practical teaching needs and challenges of the new tutoring standards have been met in the tailored course "Famous people", designed and introduced in Southern Federal University. Learning foreign language through distant course should help to create comfortable environment for informal learning. That adds to the scope of tutor responsibilities and proficiency, some aspects of which being only revealed in the practical application experience.

AB The accelerated development of information and communication technology (ICT) has an impact on ease of access to digital information. Information disseminated in the digital world is not always true and valid, thus vocational students as prospective professional workers should be equipped with digital literacy skills. One effort to improve student's digital literacy skills is by applying blended learning model that combines conventional learning model (faceto-face) with online learning model based on Learning Management System (LMS). This study aims at discovering whether there is a significant difference between control classes that apply conventional models with experimental classes that apply blended learning model. The research method used was Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design with 3 experimental classes and 3 control classes. The results of this study indicate that there are significant differences in digital literacy skills between the control classes and the experimental class, which means that the implementation of blended models can improve students' digital literacy skills.

AB This research aims to develop and test the effectiveness of digital literacy instruments on students' learning outcomes. This study is a mixed method that combines survey and pre-experimental research. The survey research was conducted through a quantitative approach using a questionnaire as the research instrument with assessed numerical items. The survey respondents consisted of 318 students from various universities in Indonesia who were taken through cluster random sampling technique. The implementation of the instrument was carried out through a pre-experimental design to 103 students to test the instrument's effectiveness. The confirmatory factor analysis result shows that the model forms three factors, which are factor 1 (communicating digital content), factor 2 (exploring digital content), and factor 3 (creating and using digital content). The result of the goodness of fit model shows that the instrument has met all the criteria with a value of X-2/df = 1.642 (<3.00), RMSEA = .079 (<= .08), GFI = .900 (>= .90), AGFI = .825 (>= .90), TLI = .939 (>= .90), and CFI = .951 (>= .90). Empirically the instrument has good discrimination power so that it can measure students' digital literacy skills at different academic ability levels (Sig. <.05). In addition, the instrument has been effectively used to measure and predict student learning outcomes (R square = .255, Sig. < .05). The instruments' result is relevant to current conditions and can further explore students' digital literacy skills.

AB Chemistry learning is faced with problems that emphasize students' difficulty in learning the basic chemistry concepts to become increasingly difficult and less meaningful. Digital literacy can understand chemistry concepts and develop critical thinking skills because digital literacy emphasizes reading, writing, understanding, evaluating, communicating, and using the information in different formats. This research aims to determine digital literacy's role and urgency for generation Z students in chemistry learning. This research is descriptive qualitative research. The research subjects were chemistry education students of FSTT of Universitas Pendidikan Mandalika. In this study, there were two types of data; primary and secondary data. The primary data was collected through direct observation and interviews. Secondary data was collected through the literature review. The results showed that digital literacy is needed in chemistry learning by focusing on Generation Z students' needs in accessing the Internet as a medium to promises ease of community connectivity, starting from how to communicate, collaborate, be creative, solve problems, make decisions, and consume information. In chemistry learning, digital technology can help improve chemistry teaching quality in technical, cognitive, and social aspects. Also, digital technology has become necessary in chemistry learning because it can help students learn better with various ICT-enabled features that can motivate understanding of chemistry concepts and reduce cognitive memory load when studying ICT-based chemistry. Thus, digital literacy is urgent for Generation Z students in chemistry learning.

AB The data show different issues connected with the digital literacy of pre-service teachers. The data were collected in 2019 among 450 teachers of pedagogical studies in Poland. The research was conducted in the biggest Polish university that trains educational staff, the Pedagogical University of Cracow. The data describe issues related to the self-evaluation of digital literacy in using text editors, spreadsheets, and presentation and graphic software. They also describe experiences with e-learning: participation in obligatory online classes, searching for information on the Internet, participation in paid and free e-learning courses, and participation in informal study groups.

   Self-directed learning
AB Self-Directed Learning (SDL) is a process in which adult learners initiate their inner motivation to learn by themselves to increase their knowledge, skills and experiences from resources and evaluating learning outcomes. Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and resources of an organization. Learners use KM to gain their knowledge. To access to these resources, the learners must know Digital Literacy Abilities (DLA). We developed a model for SDL with KM to enhance DLA: The model was synthesized from related works and verified by five experts in various fields. Data instrument was derived from focus group discussion including a five-level Likert scale of the appropriateness of the model, and experts' opinions and recommendations. Then, collected data were analyzed with content analysis; mean (), standard deviation (S.D.). After discussion, the model was adjusted according to the experts' recommendations. It contained three circles from inner to outer: SDL, KM, and DLA, respectively. SDL had four steps: readiness triggers, setting goal and planning, learning activities, and learning's evaluation. KM contained five steps: knowledge discovery, knowledge capture and storage, knowledge application and distribution, knowledge evaluation, and knowledge creation. DLA had four aspects: operation literacy, analysis and evaluation literacy, value and creation literacy, and social-culture-organization cooperation literacy. Overall, the results of analyzed data from the experts towards on appropriateness of the model were at high level (= 4.4, S.D. = 0.6). This model will be continued to implement for adult learners' activities.

AB Introduction: To meet the ambition of the UK becoming the global leader in health technology, the future workforce needs to have a developed digital literacy. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the move to online learning has also increased the requirement for a reinvention of traditional teaching methodologies (Sa & Serpa, 2020).
   Methodology: A systematic review was conducted using a mix of Boolean search terms in twelve education and health journal databases to discover the extent of current international research of digital literacy in health programmes. Papers were selected for their specificity to digital literacy in health education pre-registration professional programmes.
   Results: The initial search included 5359 papers, 3925 after duplicates removed, 134 remained after title review which were then input into Covidence for full reading, finally 47 papers being included for thematic analysis. This thematic analysis identified a number of key themes within these papers: digital literacy of the educator, digital literate workforce, technical skills limit adoption, information literacy, a curriculum requirement in education, institutional infrastructure or personal access, preparedness for entering academia, concerns over the use of digital skills, personalised digital literacy experience, increased communication skills with digital literacies, competency frameworks, COVID-19 and social media in education.
   Conclusion: This research identifies areas of good practice and areas that need to be considered in higher education programmes and by academics to ensure the digital literacy of the future healthcare workforce.

AB The present research aims to examine how students who are digital natives cope with new ways of communicating in the Digital Age. With this purpose, we introduced for the first time the use of a microblogging platform in the course of International Finance. This subject is taught in the University of Granada in the degree in Accounting and Finance. We asked undergraduates to engage with the microblogging platform in order to follow the updates through it. The main objective was to increase students' participation and engagement with the lectures, but also to enhance the communication teacher-student and also between peers, and to stimulate active informal learning. Students who accomplished this task were incentivized with extra scores in their final grade. Afterwards, we explored the degree of engagement and the students' performance, and how both were influenced by the level of digital literacy and the perception of information overload.

AB This paper analyzes the professional ethical knowledge of teachers in the use of technologies by teachers in training. Based on the disciplinary pedagogical technological knowledge (TPACK) model, it is intended to measure the correct inclusion of technologies in the classroom. For this, a descriptive exploratory methodological design study was carried out. The instruments used have been the Likert scale questionnaire and the personal interview, organized into four dimensions in which the self-perception of professional ethical knowledge, ethical knowledge of technology, pedagogical technological ethical knowledge and disciplinary technological ethical knowledge of the future teachers. The questionnaire has been applied to a sample of 1.051 trainee teachers from a European university in the context of COVID-19 and 822 students participated in the interview.The results show the scarce training in professional ethical knowledge of teachers in training and the importance of addressing this knowledge in the 21st century, a post-pandemic context. Another of the conclusions is the need to include the ethical component in the TPACK model to achieve a correct and ethical use of digital resources in the classroom.

AB The changes and transformations experienced in today's world have led to daily use of digital technologies shaping new ways of living and working, and the educational field has been no exception. Given the need to digitally enable teachers to improve their pedagogical practice in the society of the 21st century, this study sought to define the indicators that can serve as a basis for designing a model of continuous training in digital competencies for teachers using a qualitative research approach. A rigorous content analysis of institutional materials, semi -structured interview reports and focus group reports was carried out, with their triangulation leading to the design guidelines. The results indicate that the role of digital technologies in the educational process analyzed is meager; the participating teachers state that a continuous training strategy is required to meet their specific needs, and that the emerging digital competencies should focus on the creation of content and the implementation of the hybrid modality. Although these findings are not generalizable, as they do not relate to a specific environment, the analysis process is replicable and can be used in other environments. It is concluded that it is essential to have a continuous training model that makes use of a technology adaptable to the particular needs of the contexts in which it is to be implemented.

AB We present the main findings of a case study focusing on the digital literacy practices of a Portuguese early childhood teacher known for her innovative pedagogical methods. Data was collected through an in-depth interview centred on the teacher's perceptions about her digital literacy practices and on the professional development underpinning such practices. The thematic content analysis of the data was based on core principles of early childhood pedagogy, multiliteracies and professional development theories. It revealed that, from this teacher's perspective, the application of digital literacy practices has both enhanced and challenged her pedagogy. Moreover, the analysis showed that her innovative practices combine functional professional learning with attitudinal dispositions such as professionalism, professional identity, resilience and commitment. Overall, our research highlights the importance of combining both functional and attitudinal dimensions in professional development initiatives aiming to enhance renewed integration of digital literacy practices in early childhood education.

DE Teacher Professional Development; education informatization
AB Education informatization is one of the paramount issues in educational reform. To resonate with Chinese national progress in technology development and national policy for promoting education reform and modernization, this study ascertains the current status of education informatization and teachers' use of technology in teaching and learning in China. Data from a national survey on primary and secondary schools and teachers about the performance of education informatization was analyzed. According to the results, teachers' use of technology in teaching is a reinforcement of traditional pedagogy; innovative functions such as the communication and evaluation of teaching and learning are under-utilized. On the basis of this finding, promoting education informatization needs to promote teachers' coherent Digital Literacy (DL) integration competence. Meanwhile, a professional gap in using digital educational resources was found among teachers. The Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST) and the research team have put sustained efforts to guide the development of education informatization in China, and the results of this study serve as evidence for policymakers and principles to promote teacher professional development in line with the changes of new requirements for teachers' teaching ability in this information era.

AB The article discusses the problem of the gap between young people's digital skills and their ability to use the digital world in a safe and constructive way. The relevance of the work is to address this problem in the development of digital education for young people, which should include functional skills and promote the development of critical thinking, self-expression, and information analysis. In addition, it is important to build young people's cultural awareness and identity. By taking a comprehensive approach to digital education, young people will not only be able to address digital illiteracy, but also be empowered to participate constructively in the digital world and understand its norms and ethical principles.<br /> Using a research-based approach that included semi structured interviews, the article investigated digital literacy education in the context of the twenty-first century, focusing on digital devices used in both formal and informal digital spheres. The results showed how these devices help shape and develop young people's digital literacy. Digital competence, which includes the ability to evaluate available information and use interactive tools responsibly, is one of the key skills that help people to realise themselves and develop in modern society. The article also explores the use of digital learning tools that promote critical thinking among students. Specially created video blogs by university students proved to be educationally valuable and contributed to reflective processes and digital education. This approach contributes to a deeper understanding of digital literacy education and supports the idea of the importance of digital culture in actively engaging young people in the digital world. In conclusion, this article highlights the importance of developing digital education for young people, which provides them with the skills and competencies to use the digital world safely and constructively. This approach enables young people to realise their potential in a young digital society and understand its norms and ethical principles.

AB When storytelling is combined with play-based activities, it can provide an effective stimulus for early literacy. The present study investigated the effects of a structured storytelling approach on the development of young children's literacy and digital literacy skills. Three classes in two public kindergartens participated in an experimental study involving 62 children, aged 5-6 years. Each classroom was assigned to one of three experimental conditions. In one classroom, the children engaged in their regular literacy activities. In a second classroom, literacy development was supported with storytelling and associated play-based activities, while in the third classroom, children engaged in digital storytelling and activities. Outcomes were assessed by tests of early literacy and digital literacy skills before and after the 6-week intervention. The findings showed that both storytelling conditions significantly enhanced children's literacy and digital literacy skills. Structured storytelling activities provide a viable and valuable way to enhance literacy and digital literacy in early childhood education. ResumeLorsque le recit d'histoires est combine a des activites ludiques, il peut constituer un stimulus efficace d'alphabetisation en jeune enfance. La presente etude a examine les effets d'une approche structuree de la narration d'histoires sur le developpement de competences en literatie et numeratie chez de jeunes enfants. Trois classes de deux maternelles publiques ont participe a une etude experimentale menee aupres de 62 enfants ages de 5 a 6 ans. Chaque classe a ete affectee a l'une de trois conditions experimentales. Dans une classe, les enfants ont participe a leurs activites de literatie habituelles. Dans une deuxieme classe, le developpement de la literatie etait soutenu par la narration d'histoires et associe a des activites de jeu, tandis que dans la troisieme classe, les enfants ont participe a des recits d'histoires et a des activites informatises. Les resultats ont ete evalues par des tests de competences prescolaires en literatie et numeratie avant et apres l'intervention de 6 semaines. Les resultats montrent que les deux conditions experimentales de recits d'histoires ont significativement ameliore les competences des enfants en matiere de literatie et numeratie. Des activites structurees de narration d'histoires constituent un moyen viable et precieux d'ameliorer la literatie et la literatie numerique en education de la petite enfance. ResumenLa incorporacion de cuentos en las actividades ludicas puede brindar un estimulo efectivo en la educacion de lectoescritura en ninos de preescolar. El presente estudio investigo los efectos de un metodo estructurado de cuentos en el desarrollo de habilidades de lectoescritura y lectoescritura digital en ninos pequenos. Tres clases de dos grupos de kinder en instituciones publicas participaron en un estudio experimental que incluyo 62 ninos en edades entre 5 y 6 anos. A cada salon de clase se le asigno una de las tres condiciones experimentales. En un salon de clase, los ninos participaron en sus actividades normales de lectoescritura. En el segundo salon de clase, el desarrollo de lectoescritura se apoyo en actividades de cuentos, mientras que en el tercer salon de clase los ninos participaron en actividades de cuentos digitales. Los resultados de la intervencion fueron evaluados mediante pruebas de habilidades de lectoescritura temprana y de lectoescritura digital antes y despues de la intervencion de seis semanas.
   Los hallazgos mostraron que ambas condiciones experimentales mejoraron significativamente las habilidades de lectoescritura y lectoescritura digital de los ninos. Las actividades estructuradas que incorporan cuentos brindan una forma viable y valiosa para mejorar la lectoescritura y lectoescritura digital en la educacion infantil temprana.

AB This text is the result of a bibliographical research, analytical and descriptive, a methodological perspective of the State of knowledge or State of the art, about digital literacy teacher training. Conducted a survey of theses and dissertations of postgraduate courses in the strict sense of the institutions of higher education of the State of Minas Gerais, in the period of 2000 to June 2017, aiming to identify which trends academic productions present the investigation on digital literacy in teacher training. As theoretical framework, discusses the Cyberculture with Levy (1999), from the perspective of literacy Soares (1996, 2002, 2014), Street (2014) and Rojo 92003, 2012), digital literacy with Snyder (1999). As a result has been that the research is still incipient in treating of the theme and even surface, in some cases blending the determinism and relativism. There is a diversity in theoretical constructs that, consequently, show heterogeneity when it comes to teacher training.

DE Inclusion; digital media; teachers' education
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Confidence as well as the attitude - according to Blackwell, Lauricella, and Wartella [1] - seem to be the most influential factors for teachers' use of digital technology in primary school. In so far, teachers' education plays a most relevant part in developmental processes of the educational system in the digitally mediatized world. As results of the ICILS (International Computer and Information Literacy Study) 2013 study [2] show, especially German teachers are still far behind in a habituated [3] and competent digital behavior - compared, e.g., to teachers in Canada or Denmark.
   Besides the use of modern digital technology, it is the professional realization of inclusion, which represents a challenge in present teachers education processes. Understanding teachers' professionalization as a form of transfer of theoretical knowledge as well as practical training, it seems to be useful to integrate both aspects into university studies.
   Considering the idea of T-PACK (Technical Pedagogical Content Knowledge) [4] and extending that explanatory model for teachers' competencies on the inclusive practices, teachers' students of German Language and Literature, as well as rehabilitation sciences, started a three years project. University education and school practice work together to enable students of different school types to combine theoretical knowledge about an inclusive use of digital media with practical experience in class. Working together in groups representing both educational subjects, German Language and Literature as well as rehabilitation sciences, theoretical knowledge as well as confidence for the competent use of tablets helping to create settings for inclusive reading education and training came together. As part of a twelve-week-university course, the students develop an own digital project, which they realize in one of the universities partner schools.
   The present article will outline the course structure as well as the theoretical background of the whole teaching project. Besides, it draws the attention on accompanying research study [5] examining the awareness for theoretical knowledge of the students. The question arises in how far the practical teaching experience itself - as most of the students assess the professionalization process themselves - is the reason for their attitude towards digital media and inclusion. The presentation will ask based on qualitative data out of guided interviews, in how far a longer established theoretical background [6] or a rather immediate experience of self-efficacy [7] is influencing the way students describe their attitude and confidence in the inclusive use of digital media.

AB The COVID-19 brought several new challenges for the students and lecturers, particularly in higher education. The conventional physical classroom was almost instantly pushed into a new environment: a remote session class. And this lecturing paradigm shift occurred, necessarily, in a short period of time. The lecturing players suffered the pressure of using different learning tools and methodologies while exposing themselves to, in most part of cases, unexpected cybersecurity threats. The purpose of this article is to clarify all the new menaces that arose during this period. Also, to understand the level of exposure and impacts on the lecturer and student to this quick but necessary paradigm shift. Methodologically: two focus groups were undertook to capture representations of students about uses of computer technology; differences in exposure to threats before and during the pandemic and impacts on society; student's needs regarding the topic and suggestions about strategies for increasing overall knowledge about it. Answers were treated recurring to software webQDA (R)-Qualitative Data Analysis Software for analysis of qualitative data. Results depict the exposure to cybersecurity issues and some level of knowledge about them, inducing preventive practices when using informatics technology. Sense of increasing insecurity in society is associated with the statement of increasing activity regarding cybercrime, giving way to the assumption of the need of awareness and knowledge of general public regarding this issues, and rise suggestions on teaching approaches directed to the subject.

TI Critical digital literacy in virtual exchange for ELT teacher education:
   An interpretivist methodology
SO RECALL

AB Virtual exchange (VE) is an ideal venue for digital literacy skills development (Fuchs, Hauck & Muller-Hartmann, 2012) and for critical digital literacy (CDL) (Hauck, 2019). Yet literacy is a fluid, deictic term, the meaning of which is context dependent, and digital literacies need to be defined and conceptualised within a specific context. Recent CALL literature highlights the interest in CDL from various perspectives, but how CDL is conceptualised by the VE participants themselves is not explored. Participants of this study were 37 trainee English language teachers in the UK and Turkey who joined a 6-week VE. Their ongoing reflections on CDL were captured through reflective e-portfolio entries following each VE task. Thematic analysis revealed four components of CDL in this specific VE: (1) participants' awareness of digital affordances for self-expression, (2) semiotic and interactional means to build connections, (3) ensuring inclusiveness of all community members, and (4) implications of socio-political contexts of each participant for meaning-making and interaction. We conclude that in future pedagogical implementations of VE, facilitators can foster trainee teachers' CDL development through more closely guided and informed reflection on the four themes presented in this paper. As such, this study makes a novel contribution to our understanding of CDL in VE settings for ELT teacher education by offering a social semiotic second language acquisition orientation within an interpretivist paradigm.

AB In this article, we draw on the findings of a qualitative case study of the digital practices and perceptions of four pre-service English teachers in order to make the case for an integrated situated approach to digital literacy that takes identities into account. Our case study highlighted the ways in which the student teachers' perceptions of their own digital proficiency and of the affordances of the digital acted as barriers in their classrooms. Drawing on insights from New Literacy Studies and Authentic Learning theorists, we describe how we used these findings to inform subsequent curriculum design and pedagogy. We argue that in order for student teachers to engage meaningfully with the digital, they need to be provided with models and authentic tasks in the discipline that enable them to explore and then reflect on how to use the affordances of the digital as a tool for learning in their classrooms.

AB COVID-19 has brought serious challenges to education and many other sectors. Within the educational context, the main difficulties experienced have been reported as challenges related to not only mechanical impediments-such as technology or infrastructure-but also to methodological and personal features, such as lack of motivation or online learning/teaching experiences. The abrupt transition from face-to-face to online education has created the need for some specific abilities, such as digital literacy on the side of the learners at all educational levels. In this context, this mixed-method study aims to determine the digital literacy levels of learners belonging to different school levels and whether age, gender and school degree were significant variables. This study also investigates the technology-related challenges students experienced during COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 510 participants representing different school levels, age groups, and genders; in addition, a smaller representative group (n = 30) revealed their own evaluations related to their levels of digital literacy and the technology-related challenges they had about online learning. The findings suggest that there is a statistically significant relationship between students' digital literacy and their gender and school degree, while age was not found to be a statistically significant variable. The qualitative self-reported data suggested that learners have sufficient levels of digital literacy, and that the major technology-related challenges were reported to be lack of the necessary technologies and difficulties in adapting to a new approach to learning.

AB Digital literacy constitutes the basis for citizenship in order to be effective and efficient in the 21st Century in professional and personal lives. The set of skills and competences integrating digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education. During the lockdown globally imposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive changes. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three countries' higher education institutions (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador), analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation, focusing on the development of digital literacy. The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratory-correlational scope using a questionnaire designed ad hoc and applied in a sample of 376 students. Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such as the teacher's digital skills, sources for learning that may be adapted, communication between universities and students, and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context. Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this transformation, mainly: communication, teaching, and digital competences. Otherwise, digital literacy is not being guaranteed, which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives.

AB The paper presents results of comparative research in the field of PR-education development in Russia and Kazakhstan. After the disintegration of the USSR, the paths of education development in former soviet republics divided. However, there are still many similarities due to the intergovernment cooperation and integration projects such as the Eurasia Economic Union. The study aims to understand how PR-education in Russia and Kazakhstan is developing. In particular, the study compares BA and MA education programs comparing courses in common and not in common. This project uses both quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, but is rooted in a qualitative epistemological position that recognizes the importance of locating the research within a particular social, cultural, and historical context. The authors place an emphasis on the competences in the sphere of digital public relations, assuming that skills in information technologies and digital literacy are crucial for success in the future. In order to understand dynamics of PR-education development, the authors compare statistics on student submission to the institutions of the higher education both in Russia and Kazakhstan. The numbers show that there is a big demand in PR-education in terms of students submitted and in terms of competition. In order to indicate what digital skills is needed a survey method is applied. The authors have conducted a survey with 60 BA and MA students. The survey shows that students consider their decision to become a PR-specialists as 'strategically right', but the opinion on digital literacy was controversial.

AB The new landscape in the education sector calls for diverse basic research and digital integration skills. However, basic education institutions are still facing a challenge of integrating research and digital skills in their teaching and learning approaches. In addressing this challenge, an investigation to establish the curriculum design of the Life Orientation (LO) subject regarding its structure to accommodate research and digital skills was conducted. This was achieved through literature review, document analysis, workshops and brainstorming sessions with LO teachers from two schools that are based in two provinces. Data was analysed using thematic data analysis approach, whereby Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) was embraced. The findings of the document analysis and workshops led to the development of the proposed process model for the basic research and digital skills integration into teaching and learning of the pilot subject, which can later be used for other subjects.

AB The advances from an interdisciplinary project currently under development are described. The project focuses on the innovation on Social Sciences university students' and teachers' information competencies, and its purpose is to create subject-based blended learning programs that would enhance mobile technologies. This project got a grant from the national Spanish Research, Development and Innovation Plan, focused on society challenges for their development between 2017 and 2019. The project's research follows a previous project (2011-16) devoted to the assessment of Social Sciences students' information competencies and produced the questionnaires IL-HUMASS and EVALCI. This new project proposes three action lines: 1) Diagnosis of teachers' perceptions regarding their own information competence (INFOLIT) levels and their students'. 2) Design and development of an integrative model for the acquisition and assessment of Information Competences for university students and teachers; and 3) Development of disciplinary programs, as support and integrative tools of the overall project. The research methodology we are developing is qualitative-quantitative, adapting to each research aim. Thus, we use self-assessment as well as group interviews, both with teachers and students, in order to get to know the learning customs, methodologies, strategies, initiatives and best practices. From the synthesis of teachers' and students' viewpoints we will develop learning tools that could be personalized by means of an integrative, structural and flexible model on information competences, including specific tutorials for each discipline dealt with in the research, and the appropriate applications for smartphones, focused on digital and multimedia contents.

AB The broad aim of this paper is to make the case for the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) curriculum to incorporate the development of students' skills in the use of technology or 'digital literacies'. In making this argument, reference will be made to some relevant competency frameworks used within the field and it will be proposed that these are lacking with regard to Digital Literacy. The argument will be located within the context of works on literacy and on academic discourse. It will be argued that academic literacies are socially situated and defined, rather than fixed and objectively observable. Furthermore, an attempt will be made to show that new literacy practices, and particularly new digital literacies, are evolving rather than being new manifestations of older practices.

AB The present investigation aims to identify the factors related to the integration of the Inclusion and Digital Literacy Program (IDLP or PIAD in Spanish) in the activities carried out by elementary school teachers in Mexican public institutes. To that end, a quantitative methodology with an explanatory scope was used, along with a sample size of 203 teachers from a county south of the state of Sonora, Mexico. Four remaining factors from the theoretical review (educative, personal, pragmatic and contextual) were measured and the results obtained show that the variables associated to the personal factor of the professor are those that are able to explain and impact to a greater degree the integration of the program. It concludes the presence of a manifested necessity in regards to the reformulation and development of capacitation programs and awareness over the impact of technology and the benefits that it brings with the purpose of accomplishing the learning process.

AB This paper explores and reflects on the development and testing of a mobile application designed to support lesson planning in digital production and digital literacy. The test results were a reality check for the developer team and provided key points for further development. The paper will describe the test process, divided into plan, results and actions for further development of the mobile application. The application is for use by educators in secondary schools. The application introduces basic methods for teaching digital literacy and production and provides examples of concrete learning designs. It is a huge challenge to teach digital literacy and production in secondary schools. It can be demanding to meet learning goals, plan meaningful activities and at the same time apply emerging digital tools. The application was inspired by game-based learning ideas: for example, we visualized didactical concepts using Augmented Reality (AR). The emerging AR technology combined the physical surroundings and virtual elements. Didactical concepts can be quite abstract for a new educator and the visualizations make them more familiar. The application was developed as part of a funded project exploring AR in teaching and learning in upper secondary schools in the Southern Region of Denmark. The application titled in Danish ROBOdidaktik (robo-didactics) can be downloaded from Appstore and Play store.

AB Schools need teachers' professional performance to ensure the quality of educational output. Therefore, this research explores teachers' professional performance based on digital literacy, grit, and instructional quality mediated by teaching creativity. The research participants are 465 junior- and high-school teachers in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is utilized in the data analysis, along with common method bias and correlational and descriptive analyses. The results show a significant relationship between digital literacy, grit, and instructional quality and teaching creativity and teacher professional performance. Teaching creativity also has a significant relationship with teachers' professional performance and mediates the influence of digital literacy, grit, and instructional quality on teachers' professional performance. This finding promotes a new empirical model of the causal relationship between digital literacy, grit, instructional quality, and teacher professional performance through teaching creativity. Consequently, it is proposed that teaching creativity, grit, digital literacy, and high-quality instruction can all improve teachers' professional performance. Therefore, in order to advance teachers' professional performance in the future, practitioners and researchers should discuss, modify, and possibly even adopt the new empirical model.

AB Nowadays there is a huge number of learning resources, covered different digital skills, on the Internet. In the framework of European Erasmus+ project: 'Digital Skills Accelerator' we developed dedicated to digital skills set of learning resources. Moreover, the test to analyses the level of user digital skills in form of the Online Self-Assessment Tool was developed as well. However, there is a problem with proper identification of personalized digital skills learning pathway. In the paper the expert system for creation of personalized digital skills learning pathway is proposed. The system runs on the DigComp framework to generate the user path, which consists of the ordered set of project learning resources from Digital Skills Accelerator. Selected resources best fit user's digital skills profile and will help in raising his/her digital competence. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper explores young people's development of digital literacy and resilience and discusses how teachers and librarians can play an important role in supporting young people to become digital citizens: informed, active, ethical, safe and responsible members of the online society. The research involved the delivery and evaluation of an interactive educational workshops that included an online cartoon series, accompanied by openly available educational toolkits dealing with topics of online resilience and safety in the online environment. The research involved a total of 239 secondary school pupils, across six schools and within a single local authority in Scotland. Anonymous qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the learning activities, which related to young people's experiences, coping strategies and emotions in the online environment. The workshops empowered young people to open dialogue about challenging situations they experience in their everyday online connectivity and express their needs for further training. This work presents an innovative constructivist learning approach that can be replicated with young people to explore multiple challenges and opportunities they may encounter when navigating their online environment.

AB The New National Curriculum in Norway from 2006 recommends that teachers and students acquire a high degree of digital literacy in school education. One way to foster digital literacy is to train teachers to design and critically evaluate digital learning resources (DLRs). However, little research has been done as to which design principles and evaluation criteria are suitable for DLRs. This work proposes a theoretical framework, along with a case study, for designing and evaluating DLRs. The article draws on research in learning theory, pedagogical usability criteria, and context of use. The paper reports on the implications of the framework for the design and evaluation of DLRs.

AB Collaborative-constructivist online learning appears well aligned with Ukraine's post-revolutionary aspirations for globalised and transformed higher education. This study explores digital competencies of students and professors at Kyiv National Economic University, Ukraine, to probe readiness for fully online collaborative learning. The General Technology Competency and Use profile tool was completed by 244 participants to measure digital experience and confidence across four categories of human-computer activity. To assess readiness, reported levels of competencies were related to the three dimensions of successful collaborative learning described by the Community of Inquiry model. Despite some key differences between students and teachers, general findings include moderate-to-low levels of self-reported technical, social and informational competency, accompanied by consistently low levels of epistemological competency. These findings suggest that neither students nor teachers are adequately prepared for achieving high levels of social, cognitive and teaching presence in a fully online learning environment. It is recommended that digital-competency development become an educational priority.

AB Online distance education allows easy and convenient access to learning opportunities. As with other forms of education, high self-efficacy often encourages greater student confidence and autonomy. While self-efficacy has been shown to have positive effects in face-to-face education, its antecedents and consequences in online distance education are less clear. This study addresses this issue. First, it considers two important antecedents: attitude and digital literacy. Second, the study considers the effects of self-efficacy on three important learning behaviors: peer engagement, learning management system (LMS) interaction and course convener interaction. Findings from an online survey of 151 postgraduate business students suggest that positive student attitude and digital literacy significantly contribute to self-efficacy. In turn, self-efficacy has positive effects on peer engagement, learning management system (LMS) interaction and convener interaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Students of today are digital natives. They acquire their digital literacy autonomously and are adept at using various Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to enrich their daily leisure life. Although prior research has addressed such phenomenon and its relation to school learning, the focus was mostly on students' adoption of ICT tools to facilitate their learning: This study takes a further step by relating students' digital literacy to their school curriculum and using the pedagogy of negotiated learning to improve their learning autonomy. The proposed negotiated learning design is to scaffold students along the authenticity-generalizability continuum; from operation-oriented knowledge and experience of ICT tools to the theory and technique of tools development and operation. It is expected that, by relating the school learning to students' digital literacy, the way of students' autonomously acquiring their digital literacy outside school may help them develop autonomy in school learning. For validating the proposal, an experiment with 36 university students studying the engineering course of multimedia technology has been implemented and evaluated. The qualitative results showed that participants developed their autonomy to exercise their digital literacy to resolve the difficulties they faced during Web exploration and data collection for their school learning. The quantitative data also evidenced their improvement of learning autonomy. The findings and the way how the learning practice is designed and implemented should offer teachers a different perspective of connecting school learning with students' digital literacy acquired outside schools. Moreover, under the trend of youngsters' digital literacy development, the findings provide a positive perspective on students' digital literacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Over the years, the Spanish education authorities have proposed various guarantee the inclusion of all students in the education system. However, the literature on this topic indicates the persistence of certain challenges relating to the accessibility of OERs. In this regard, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is presented as a possible solution to this problem as it advocates the personalisation of learning and facilitates the achievement of universal digital literacy. This study seeks to investigate the accessibility of OERs' design for those early stages in education that are managed by the Spanish education authorities. To this end, a guide of indicators has been designed to assess OERs in accordance with the principles of UDL. The sample is made up of 67 OERs, selectively based on a number of requirements. This study uses a quantitative and exploratory research methodology for the analysis of the data obtained. The main findings highlight the shortcomings of OERs in terms of accessibility, adaptability and universality, demonstrating that OERs do not respond to the principles of UDL.

AB For the correct exploitation of information and communication technologies (ICT), teachers need to develop digital skills that allow them to apply new methodologies, such as Learning and Knowledge Technologies (TAC) and Technologies for Empowerment and Participation (TEP) and make the most of its potential. To address this problem, a questionnaire on methodological digital skills was applied to 58 teachers from two higher education institutions in the city of Santo Domingo, Ecuador. The study showed that teachers have developed methodological digital skills and others not so much, which indicates the need to train them in educational institutions. This process of innovation in the physical and virtual spaces of academic work requires the guidance of educational institutions and the participation of teachers. The study was carried out using a questionnaire with 26 option items with a Likert scale and the dimensions of didactic design, planning and implementation were used; organization and management of digital spaces and resources; communication and collaboration; ethics and digital citizenship and professional development. The sample consisted of university professors and the higher institute of Administration, Accounting, Law, Medicine, Dentistry and Software careers.

ID COMPETENCE
AB Foreign language proficiency and digital literacy are key aspects of today's education. Consequently, if teachers are responsible for providing students with opportunities for the best learning experiences so that they can discover their potential and put their skills into practice, it seems evident that the competences of these professionals cannot be overlooked. Research is profuse when analyzing the teachers' digital literacy in different contexts, including in-service and pre-service ones in areas such as English as a Foreign Language and bilingual education. However, it is necessary to examine how future teachers view their digital competence in hybrid education settings derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the self-perceived digital competence of a group of pre-service primary teachers of English and bilingual education studying at the University of Cordoba (Spain) that have received hybrid education during the 2020/21 academic year. A quasi-experimental design and a quantitative approach based on the use of a questionnaire are followed. Findings show that surveyed teachers show general positive attitudes in relation to their digital literacy, and gender differences are only statistically significant when considering self-perceived competence in terms of searching, accessing, and selecting online content for teaching purposes in favor of men. It seems clear that specific training is still needed among future teachers of English and bilingual education in this respect.

AB This article deals with the construction and validation of the Model of Digital Competences in Distance Education (DE) entitled MCompDigEAD. It is an exploratory-descriptive research, with a qualitative approach carried out between 2014 and 2018 in Brazil, through three procedures. In the first, mapping and validation of digital competences with analysis and comparison between theoretical reference, case studies with DE students and specialists. In the second, construction of the model through four procedures: Conception, Planning, Modeling and Validation. In the third validation jointly, the Open University of Catalonia (OUC). As a result, we obtained a model composed of seven areas: introduction to digital technologies, digital communication, network information management, digital health and safety, digital citizenship and presence, digital content creation and development and transversal, divided into three digital competencies general: functional digital literacy, critical digital literacy and digital fluency, fourteen specific competences detailed through knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA) and three levels of proficiency, initial, intermediate and advanced with use case examples. MCompDigEAD is a model for the purpose of orienting and assisting learning processes in DE, serving as a reference for different institutions in educational contexts at a distance.

AB Currently, in the context of an introduction of digital ICT in education, we are facing a problem of determinants in successful digital education that are compatible with the primary educational goals. Under the term significant determinants we understand digital competencies of teachers that necessarily become a subject of development. These competencies are pragmatically reflected in the frames or documents that describe the pedagogical training of future teachers. The author's intention is to outline an alternative holistic perspective of understanding pedagogical training in future teachers and their digital competencies that are based more on phenomenology and hermeneutics. This perspective reflects a psychagogic approach to education. The author believes that future student training is expressed in,ars docendi" also in digital education and this,ars docendi" cannot be achieved without student's self-reflection of their relationship with ICT, but especially not without self-understanding in terms of values and meaning. This self-understanding leads to moral self-awareness and responsibility. The author points out that it is necessary to accommodate the future teacher's personal self-reflection and self-projection and incorporate also those psychagogically relevant elements that would be complementary in the process of developing digital competencies. This will allow overcoming challenges of future teacher education, considering the psychagogic needs in education.

AB This paper addresses a key issue in the development of youth-focused social work: the role of digital skills in the relationship between young people and social workers who work with these native digital users. To this end, we analysed data from the International Digital Economy and Society Index 2019 and Eurostat. Information from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey and a survey conducted by the Social Care Institute for Excellence and the British Association of Social Workers supported the empirical analysis. The main findings reveal a gap between the level of digital skills required in the labour market and the actual level of digital skills in both young people and social workers, despite efforts by both groups to improve their skills. Initiatives to foster digital skills are therefore recommended to bridge this digital divide. Lastly, it was concluded that both groups could act as mutual drivers of digital transformation.

AB Digital skills are key enablers in a wide spectrum of jobs that require the use of digital tools for information search, communication and problem-solving. The interest on digital skills training has resulted in frameworks and offerings at different educational levels. However, there is a limited understanding on the relative importance of these skills for different stakeholders, and on the instructional methods that may better facilitate their acquisition in the Higher Education (HE) context as a preparation for the workplace. Here we report the results of a trans-national study on the perceptions of different stakeholder groups (namely students, employers, instructors and civic institutions) about the relative importance of digital competences, the effectiveness of current offerings and the best approaches for their acquisition. The European DigComp 2.1 framework for digital skills was used as a way of structuring the inquiry process based on surveys and focus groups. Results showed some differences in perception across groups and a clear focus on information search and communication abilities as priorities, but also to a perceived gap between the needs and the actual abilities of students. Results also point out to situated and problem-based learning approaches as adequate instructional methods.

AB The competence-based pedagogical model is having a significant influence on the debate about aligning Higher Education to labour market requirements. For that reason, each discipline needs to continuously monitor job prospects and adjust the university's competence curricula accordingly. In this context, the purpose of this research is to analyse the existence of a possible gap between market requirements and education in relation to students' digital competence level, and possible mismatches by sex and field of knowledge. To verify the correct match between the market and the development of digital competencies, a twophase research was conducted. In the first phase, the content of job offers was analysed, as methodology to determine the digital competences needed to perform a job. In the second phase, a survey was carried out among undergraduate students and their potential employers to evaluate their digital competence level. Employers were asked to evaluate the perceived level of digital competences that graduate students have (or, 'what level of digital competence have graduate acquired at the university?'). In the case of students the questionnaire was self-evaluative (or, 'what level of digital competence do you think you have acquired at the university?'). The results of the study show some differences or gaps amongst university students in the use and digital competence level by both sex and field of study Additionally, this study shows differences between the competence level perceived by the students and the level perceived by the labour market, which represents a clear mismatch between education and labour market.

AB In the context of education, strategies and innovations are constantly being made to adapt to the dizzying changes that occur within the framework of globalization. This year, exceptionally, as a result of the global health emergency generated by Covid-19, education, like all other sectors of society, has been forced to implement a distance communication system aided by digital technologies for effective connectivity. It is in this scenario where lack of competence and abilities have been seen in students, having to adapt to these new virtual classroom conditions. The objective of this study is to diagnose gaps in access to ICTs and the level of technological knowledge present in public education students in the Nuble region, Chile. The research utilizes the quantitative method, analyzing the objective reality by means of a survey-questionnaire type instrument, to collect quangfiable data and carry out the corresponding statistical analysis. The results show that more than 50% of the participants can conduct themselves in the digital field, perform basic functions to surf the internet and carry out school work. However, 47% dedicate a significant time of their attention and connectivity, in social networks, through the mobile phone, even exceeding seven hours a day. The conclusions focus on the importance of integrating, in all public educational establishments, sufficient digital literacy to ensure quality and equitable access to knowledge for all students.

AB The mass use of the Internet, networks and digital devices has intensified the training processes in digital literacy; however, the risks related to the safety of users have also increased. The objective of this article is to analyze the scientific production related to digital security literacy, as well as to identify consolidated and emerging lines of research. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was carried out during the 2010-2020 period, taking as sources of information the Scopus and Web of Science databases. We used the systematic literature review method which has been adjusted for its application in the area of social sciences. The results indicate that most of the scientific texts have been produced in English, and that the treatment of the subject has been developed from perspectives related to criteria for the protection of personal data. Therefore, it is concluded that there is a need to develop a more solid body of scientific work that considers aspects such as safety in social networks, skills for digital security and digital intelligence.

AB It is an era in which the level of national digital literacy is the adaptability and competitiveness of the future society. In line with these times, studies on various literacy education and programs are being actively conducted in the field of lifelong education. However most of them are fragmentary event education or one-time programs. It is difficult to say that it is an education for continuous improvement of digital literacy capabilities.
   Lifelong education institutions need educational programs and teachers that able to not onlyutilize ICT but also communicate through digital, exchange information and creatively construct newly accepted information. For this it is necessary to measure the digital literacy competency and level of lifelong education teachers to properly recognize the digital literacy competency required for their job.
   They can continually develop and test their digital literacy capabilities by repeating these measurements, This study aims to present a methodology for developing competency diagnosis tools in the categories of digital ethics, digital competence, and digital application according to the education association's digital literacy framework.

AB Digital literacy endures to sway educational leaders' choices and actions as they guide faculty in effectual distance education. Andragogy, continuous education, and digital literacy, the frameworks, should be in sync to provide quality outcomes through business process improvement. To sustain excellent results, faculty must develop and maintain key performance measures to deliver successful job performance. Skill enhancement is important to current and future successes. The development of knowledge, skills, ability, and competency augmentations must be contextualized in digital literacy understanding and application. If left unchecked, unchallenged, and latent, a chasm in digital literacy will limit intellectual growth, and diminish educational standings on the world's stage of accomplishments. This paper assesses digital literacy requirements, needs and influences as they continue to control and shift 21st century actions and ideals. Moreover this presentation investigates educational technological understandings of students, faculty, and educational administrators. A survey was conducted and revealed key data points into the direction of future technological educational needs. Further, this document serves to guide practitioners and inform academes in digital literacy structure, methodology, and challenges.

AB Introduction: The digital transformation has far-reaching implications for the qualification profile of medical students, which have not been addressed in medical studies so far.
   Teaching concept: The competence-oriented blended learning curriculum "Medicine in the digital age" has been implemented at Mainz University Medical Centre since 2017. It represents a curricular reform project of the "Curriculum 4.0" program (Stifterverband). In six modules, the qualification requirements for digital skills are addressed.
   Evaluation Methodology: The qualitative evaluation of the course concept took place in the form of semi-structured interviews. All 58 participants from five courses were interviewed.
   Results: Using the "Qualitative Content Analysis" according to Philipp Mayring, the statements were divided into deductive main categories (process, content, methodology, learning success, learning experience and conclusion). The results reflect the students view of the curriculum and the current qualification needs that still need to be specialised.
   Discussion: The didactic teaching of digital skills is a relevant and highly topical component of the further development of medical studies. In this development, the focus is not only on technological skills, but also on the

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between perceived stress/digital literacy and student satisfaction in health science college students in the distance education process. Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted by collecting data from 842 students. The dependent variable was student satisfaction in distance education. For the analyses, t-test, ANOVA (post hoc: Bonferroni), and linear regression methods were used. Results: Distance education student satisfaction was 178.21 +/- 48.64. Student satisfaction was low among those who think that distance education is not more effective than face-to-face education, live in villages/towns, and have high perceived stress. Student satisfaction was high among those who do not have limited internet access, can access the internet via computer, follow the lessons regularly every week, think distance education is applicable in the health domain, can acquire instant feedback from the instructor, and have increased digital literacy. Conclusion: Distance education student satisfaction was found to be moderate. Student satisfaction in distance education increases as perceived stress levels decrease and digital literacy levels increase.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic and the infodemic that accompanied it, digital literacy proved to be a preventive approach with the possibility of offering future guidance to contemplate the negative influences of digital media in the post-pandemic context. However, this emphasis on the potentialities of digital literacy requires, at the same time, a review of its traditional assumptions, in order to optimize its characteristics in the future context. One of the central aspects of this review is related to the inclusion of the interference that cognitive biases have in the use of contemporary digital media, in which misinformation and misinformation proliferate. A clear example of this during the pandemic has been the spread of multiple conspiracy theories. Starting from here, the objective of this article will be to analyze the possible contribution of metacognition, when it is understood as a fundamental component of digital literacy.

AB Digital literacy development at the university level is necessary for facing Industrial Revolution 4.0. This research is ex post facto research that examines the phenomena that occur in the learning process. The study was conducted from April to August 2021, with 64 respondents from all universities with Biology Education Study Programs in Bali involved in filling out Metacognitive Ability, Selfregulated Learning, and Digital Literacy questionnaires distributed through Google Forms. The tabulated data were then analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling - Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) SMART PLS 3.0. The results showed that the contributions of metacognitive abilities to the digital literacy skills of biology education students in Bali were 23.1%. In the other hand, contributions of metacognitive abilities to self-regulated abilities were 41.8%. The conclusion from this study is that in biology learning metacognitive abilities make a significant contribution to digital literacy compared to self-regulated learning.

AB Digital literacy is the product of information age development and has become a necessary skill in the field of people's survival. Based on the analysis of literature review and its contents, this paper studies deeply the concept and contents of digital literacy. The analysis results show that digital literacy has the feasibility of cultivating diversified talents and enhancing the quality of foreign language courses in the process of foreign language teaching in colleges and universities. On this basis, this paper constructs four new teaching modes: (1) library service mode to enrich the resources of knowledge base; (2) mixed mode to stimulate students' learning enthusiasm; (3) listening, speaking, reading, writing and translating mode to improve students' comprehensive ability of foreign language; (4) digital device mode to create an ecological environment in colleges and universities. Through the above four new foreign language teaching modes, it is hoped to promote the cultivation of compound talents in colleges and universities and provide a reference for promoting the process of foreign language education in China.

AB At present, the current educational result is functional literacy of students, which is consistently confirmed by a number of different-level normative documents (Presidential Decrees; Orders of the Rosobrzor and the Russian Ministry of Education; letters from departments and ministries, GEF).
   The development of functional literacy is usually attributed to one of the basic general education's results, but the future teachers training also needs to address functional literacy of students during the subject learning. We talk about the need to create didactic conditions that allow students not only to improve their own level of functional literacy, but also to master a set of measures and procedures for the student's functional literacy formation in their further professional activities.
   The development of functional literacy is a current trend, including the teaching of foreign languages, but the number of the development of functional literacie's studies in particular languages is unevenly distributed. Thus, the issue of developing functional literacy in Chinese language teaching is not well understood at present.
   In this regard, the purpose of this article is to consider the development of digital literacy as a component of functional literacy when teaching Chinese language to students of the Pedagogical University's Faculty of Foreign Languages.
   Since one of the main modern education's characteristics is its digital orientation, implying the active use of new technologies and digital resources by the educational process participants with a view to its effective implementation, one of the most sought-after components of functional literacy today is digital literacy. Accordingly, students of the Pedagogical University's Faculty of Foreign Languages should further develop their own level of digital literacy in the process of learning Chinese language.
   The study revealed the specifics of the digital literacy formation as a component of functional literacy in the teaching of the Chinese language at a pedagogical university. In Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University while teaching students of the Foreign Languages Faculty, the direction of training 44.03.05 Pedagogical education, profile: Foreign (Chinese) and Foreign (English) language is used a set of linguistic digital educational environment elements integrated within the framework of the subject and practical training of students. The application of the wide range of the linguodigital environment elements in the teaching of Chinese contributes to the development of digital literacy among students. Thus, digital literacy is taught through language training of future Chinese language teachers.
   The article contains examples of the linguo-digital educational environment elements integrated within the framework of the subject and practical training of students used in the educational process, contributing to the development of the Chinese language future teachers digital literacy. As a perspective of the study, the authors note the need to further deepen and concretize the studied question by determining the content and structure of the Chinese language future teachers digital literacy, levels and criteria of its formation, as well as basic methods of developing digital literacy through training.

AB This article reports the results of a study that took place at a private university in Bogota, Colombia. An English language course was the scenario for applying a set of sessions that sought to determine how blended learning could influence the development of digital skills for creativity and communication via a pedagogical intervention during an academic term. A quasi-experimental design was carried out to measure the variable 'communication and content creation skills' by conducting a pre- and post-test survey. From the statistical test, the general hypothesis was accepted for the scope of this study, stating that the b-learning model did not develop the skills chosen in this implementation meaningfully. These findings imply that creativity and communication skills can be influenced by this model; also, thought-content-creation skills received a major influence according to the internal statistical tests. However, the statistical tests that comprised this method also suggested that the impact was not high enough to prove the main hypothesis. Furthermore, findings provide an opportunity to explore research designs that are not common in this field of education.

AB In the modern world, digital environment has become so empowering that computers and other digital technologies have become such a basic part of life. As such, being digitally illiterate is no longer an option; it is deemed to be a necessity in education, workplace, and for every internet user. To prepare themselves for the challenges in the workplace, higher education students need to develop their digital literateness. An integrated concept of Communities of Practice and Mobile Learning is proposed as a pedagogical model to improve students' digital literacy mirroring the criteria of the International Standards of Technology in Education.

ID INVESTMENT; IDENTITY; MEDIA; MODEL
AB This study addresses the urgent need to develop innovative pedagogies that build upon and enhance the digital literacies and representational practices of culturally and linguistically diverse youth from refugee backgrounds. In Canadian high schools, this population of students enter school with varying levels of literacy in their first language(s), as well as potentially difficult experiences due to their forced migration. For many, learning English, may become a formidable challenge. A growing corpus of case studies is beginning to show how pedagogies that draw on youths' everyday meaning making, including their digital literacies, can effectively engage English learners in academic learning. In this qualitative, ethnographic case study involving nine youth in an English language learning classroom, we addressed the question: What is the potential for digital storytelling to draw from the fuller context of the lives and literacies of youth from refugee backgrounds to enable more autonomous language learning and identity affirmation? Our study is informed by interrelated conceptual frameworks: learner autonomy; investment in language and literacy learning; and digital literacies. Using thematic and multimodal/visual analysis, data were collaboratively coded to identify four interweaving themes: 1) use of multimodal meaning making to communicate complex, critical understandings; 2) emergence of digital literacies; 3) challenges of communicating in digital spaces; and 4) investment in identity affirmation in language learning. Implications focus on how digital storytelling as an innovative pedagogy has the potential to create space within the curriculum for stories that have deep meaning for learners.

AB Social and economic participation is increasingly dependent on the proficient use of digital technologies in everyday life. Digital skills, alongside literacy and numeracy, are now foundational skills that all Australians should have. Yet, how policy makers, scholars, and adult educators can effectively identify people's current and desired digital skills is not well established. Existing frameworks tend to be instrumentalist, listing generic abilities that all citizens need for success. Digital abilities, however, are context-specific and attempts to generalise need to be responsive to local circumstances. We present a theory-driven Digital Ability Self-Assessment Tool, developed for a government agency and piloted in a community organisation. The Tool takes a distinctive socio-material approach to overcome shortcomings of other digital ability assessment tools, which often focus on normative measures of skills attainment. Overall, we argue that authentic digital skills policy and programme development must account for the contexts in which digital technologies are used.

Research aim is to measure the information and digital literacy activities of librarians in the national lifelong learning portal, and to test application of an Experience API (xAPI) as an information and a digital literacy assessment instrument. The introductory overview of theories brings umbrella framework for overlapping terms such as digital literacy, information literacy, media literacy and digital competences. Convergence or overlapping of terms largely depends on prospective aim of the assessment process, which could be regarded as normative/pedagogical or instrumental/technical in nature [1-2]. The paper presents a case study of testing an Experience API standard as an information and digital literacy assessment.

AB Selection of the proper media is one of the teacher's duties in teaching. It must be followed by several aspects, one of which is teacher's ability in digital literacy to keep up with the developments of today's all-digital era. The study aimed to examine the effects of digital literacy levels on the selection of learning media for social science teachers. In the study, correlational quantitative method was used, with data collection applying questionnaires and document studies. The participants of the study were 22 social science teachers from 11 junior high schools selected via total sampling method. The obtained data were analyzed using simple linear regression. The results revealed that there was a significant effect between digital literacy on the selection of social science teacher learning media. The result of the regression equation is Y = 0.553 + 0.119X. Meanwhile, the result of hypothesis testing from the T-Test and F-Test showed that Ho was rejected and Ha was accepted.

AB Y Massive Open Online Courses with Self-Directed Learning model (SDL MOOCs model) was developed by researchers as a tool to promote learning outside the classroom for digital age learners. The concept is based on the combination of new technologies and teaching methods in order to create new ideas and innovations that can enhance learning for modern learners and, at the same time, respond directly to their learning experiences. Thus, instructors are responsible for organizing the environment and creating learner-friendly learning materials using existing technology, which can lead to a digital university learning society. The contributions of this article are: 1) to synthesize the conceptual framework of the SDL MOOCs model, 2) to develop the SDL MOOCs model, 3) to develop instructional processes with self-directed learning to enhance digital literacy skills (SDL process), and 4) to study the results of developing the SDL MOOCs model. The suitability of the SDL MOOCs model was assessed by 15 experts with extensive experience in the fields of online education design and development, computer science and information and communication technologies for education. The results of this research show that: 1) the SDL MOOCs and feedback), 2) the SDL process consists of 4 stages (preparation, web-based self-directed learning, post-testing, and certificate approval), and 3) the developmental adequacy of the SDL MOOCs model is at a very high level.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing advocacy for information literacy (IL) and digital literacy in higher education in general, and in an e-learning environment in particular. In order to support the adoption of e-learning at Ajman University of Science and Technology, the goal of the study was to measure the level of information/digital literacy skills of new education major students, at, before, and after the IL/digital training sessions. Accumulated grade point averages (AGPA) for both groups were compared after graduation.
   Scores were compared; the results of these treatments confirmed that one-shot of information/digital literacy training session is insufficient to make a significant difference and students who had more than one session gained more and performed better on assignments, the post-test and achieved a higher accumulative grade point average (AGPA).
   The results of this study are expected to provide a basis for designing and delivering an online tutorial or a regular course on information/digital literacy. An introductory information literacy course has been described and principles behind the preparation of the course have been discussed.

AB The main aim of the present research project, based on a case study, is the evaluation of 12 distant learning programs, materialized in certified educational centres in the prefecture of Heraklion in 2007, concerning the instruction of basic ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) skills to women and persons with special needs, regardless of their educational background. All programs were completed through a similar method of distant-learning (hybrid or blended learning). The duration of the programs was 100 hours, from which 30% was conducted via physical presence (seminar type "face to face" learning in the classroom) and 70% via distant-learning with an LMS (Learning Management System). One of the most important findings of the research is the apparent successful achievement of the basic educational targets, namely "digital literacy" and the learners' participation in the Information Society. The demand for faster knowledge integration, the learners' lack of appropriate material and technical equipment and the inefficiency of the educational centres to respond to these needs are recorded as shortcomings of the observed programs.

AB With the diffusion of easy-to-use Web 2.0 tools, such as podcasts, blogs and wilds, e-learning has become a popular mechanism for individual training. While individuals use these tools in the hope that their training will improve their performance, this relationship is not a given. This paper proposes that an individual's level of digital literacy affects her performance through its impact on her performance and effort expectations. To explain the influence of digital literacy on the intention of individuals to continue using e-learning and their performance, we integrate the concept of digital literacy with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and test our model using survey data from New Zealand accountants working in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results indicate that these relationships were significant: digital literacy on users' performance and effort expectations, performance expectations on users' intentions to continue using Web 2.0 tools, and continuance intention on performance. These findings suggest that individual digital literacy facilitates the use of e-learning, and should be considered when examining the impact of the latter on performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Personal learning environments (PLEs) are disrupting contemporary education, offering opportunities for enhanced use of technology for learning. To maximize these opportunities it is imperative to understand how learners' technological fluency and self-regulated learning skills are interrelated within PLEs. This paper presents the quantitative findings of an ongoing longitudinal mixed methods study to identify and describe these relationships between digital literacy and self-regulated learning skills. Structural equation modeling is used to test competing models using online survey data from 181 participants in a two-wave panel design. The results support the acceptance of a non-recursive model with significant positive reciprocal relationships between digital literacy component constructs and the self-regulated learning construct. We contribute via empirical evidence, to clarifying the direction and extent to which digital literacy and self-regulated learning skills of undergraduates influence each other. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for theory and practice together with future research opportunities.

AB This paper explores classroom support for students' acquisition of digital literacy skills for learning at the University of Dar es Salaam and Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania. The paper contains qualitative data collected through questionnaires and informal discussions. The study found limited classroom support for students' digital literacy skills for learning because instructors are not prepared for it. Teaching activities that instructors implement do not reflect the attributes of digital literacy skills students should possess. Therefore, the paper challenges universities to mainstream students' digital literacy skills and train instructors to assume the skills support role.

AB The present contribution conducts an intervention in the study and practice of digital and media literacy. After reviewing key tenets of recent debates, I advance a specific understanding of the concept - critical digital literacy - that, as I argue, comprehensively addresses issues of knowledge, competencies, and skills in relation to digital technologies. In particular, I posit that critical thinking about educational and other values of 'the digital' needs to take structural aspects of the technology into account that are often eschewed in instrumental or commercially-driven approaches. To prepare pupils for their future lives requires a widest possible contextualisation of technology, including issues of exploitation, commodification, and degradation in digital capitalism. Finally, I make concrete suggestions for constructive uses of technology in teaching and learning.

AB The sudden COVID-19 pandemic has forced many educational institutes to shut down and many students to stay home receiving online learning. This study aims to identify the changes in student roles and digital literacy and the strategies to improve motivation and learning achievement in online learning environments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a rapid evidence assessment review study based on the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA), it is concluded that student roles have experienced great changes, that students have assumed multiple roles and that they are socially and cognitively engaged in their roles, roles that can be promoted by information technologies. Their digital literacy, individually varying, needs to be improved although it has undergone improvements. Digital technologies and social regulation can improve online learning achievements. Teaching strategies, teacher-student cooperation, gamification, and computer applications can improve online learning achievements. Future research could focus on inter-disciplinary research into the models to sustain online learning during or after the pandemic.

AB In the ever-evolving digital landscape, higher education (HE) students find themselves at the crossroads of two critical aspects: their digital competencies and their digital citizenship. Given the ubiquitous integration of digital technologies in educational settings, it is essential to investigate the relationship between students' digital competencies and their ability to engage as responsible digital citizens. This study examined the nexus between digital competencies and citizenship among HE students. This study involved 247 students from a Ghanaian HE institution. Digital competency and citizenship scales were used as data collection instruments. The findings revealed that problem-solving, communication and collaboration, and digital content creation competencies had a significant positive influence on HE students' digital citizenship. Conversely, safety competence has no significant influence on digital citizenship. Interestingly, data and information literacy competence have a negative effect on digital citizenship. The implications of these findings provide valuable insights for educational institutions, policymakers, and educators to foster digital competencies and promote responsible digital citizenship among HE students.

AB The present deep impact of information technology on society results in an increasing number of countries starting to introduce information technology related topics even in primary schools. However, the resulting curricula, educational standards and competence models differ in several aspects like in their structure or competence focus, making them hard to assess and to compare. This contribution presents a graph-based approach that eases the comparison and that can be used to exemplify different focal points easily. In order to do so, we looked at several educational models and used a graph-based representation form to display the emphasis on either Digital Literacy and/or Computer Science concepts.

TI Developing digital literacy in initial EFL teacher education: A study in

AB 21(st)-century EFL teachers are assumed to be properly trained to help develop future generations' language proficiency and digital literacy. Moreover, with the impact that the current pandemic has had on education, technology seems to be the only possible way to guarantee the continuity of teaching and learning. Considering that English is the most studied foreign language in Europe, it is necessary thus to analyse whether EFL teachers believe they are prepared for such a task and whether studying at a distance university improves their training in this respect. This study examines the perceptions of pre-service teachers of English studying at the Spanish National University of Distance Education regarding their digital literacy. Through a quasi-experimental, quantitative design, findings show that participants value their digital skills positively but consider they have not worked enough on their digital literacy despite studying at a distance university. Men show more positive self-perceptions than women, while respondents with less years of university experience value their digital skills more positively. Furthermore, respondents acknowledge not knowing how to assess or improve their digital literacy. The results suggest the need for distance universities like UNED to strengthen teacher training in digital skills.

AB For higher education students, developing digital literacy enhances their value to future employers and appeal in the graduate labour market. The purpose of this study was two-fold. First, to provide a tridimensional (technical, cognitive and etiquette) conceptual framework and definition of digital literacy. Second, to investigate students' (N = 324) perceptions of their digital literacy proficiency through an online survey. Multiple linear regression revealed mixed results for different aspects of digital literacy. Students reported the lowest proficiency in using digital information, specifically in terms of evaluation and determining bias and quality of information. The highest levels of proficiency were for social literacy skills, such as communicating appropriately online. There were minor differences between genders, while work experience and length of time in higher education had positive impact. Findings highlight the need for increased focus on digital literacy adaptability and industry-relevant experience within curriculum.

AB Although the benefits of using social robots to increase engagement and boost learning are well documented (Belpaeme et al. in Sci Robot 3, 2018 [1]), less is known regarding the competencies to effectively incorporate them as a tool in online education, with the challenges and benefits thereof. This paper investigates the implementation of social robots as a pedagogical tool to support educators during online learning. Based on (Ferres and Piscitelli in Comunicar 38:75-82, 2012 [2]) framework of media and digital competencies for teachers, this study investigates these skills, and the barriers and opportunities presented for teachers when using a social robot for online distance education. By means of a thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with educators in Chile, we identified main media and digital skills: basic programming; managing information and digital data; designing interactive activities; and developing work teams. The main barriers and benefits encountered are also provided. We conclude by providing advice for practitioners and avenues for future research.

AB The result of part of a master's research entitled "Digital literacy in teaching practice: support for the integration of TDICs" (BELONI, 2019) is presented here, this work seeks to present a proposal for a questionnaire that details the articulation of digital literacy with TPACK, seeking to understand the social application of technologies according to their technological, pedagogical, content and context knowledge. As an instrument to identify the characteristics of teachers' digital literacy, a questionnaire was used. The results showed that the instrument is appropriate for the investigation of digital literacy in teaching practice. Increasingly, these professionals are required to appropriate TDICs in their practices. Thus, this research presents an instrument that can collaborate to better integrate them, since it increases the understanding of the social use of technologies in teaching practice.

ID VALIDATION
AB PurposeThe aim of this study was to shed some light on the extent to which digital literacy, epistemological belief and reading motivation and engagement predict pre-service teachers' capabilities in teaching 21st century skills.Design/methodology/approach21st Century Skills Teaching Scale, Internet based Epistemological Beliefs Scale, Internet based Reading Motivation and Engagement Scale as well as Digital Literacy Scale were used to collect the data. A total of 512 pre-service teachers from four universities in T & uuml;rkiye participated in the study. Descriptive statistics, correlation and structural equation model fitness tests were performed by using SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 22.0.FindingsFirst, the results of the correlations analysis indicated that there were statistically significant positive correlations among measured variables. Second, the results of the path and SEM model fit tests demonstrated that all the model fit indices of X2/df, TLI, CFI, RMSEA met the acceptable criteria and were shown to be an adequate model structure. Finally, the results demonstrated strong evidence for predicting effects of digital literacy, epistemological belief as well as reading motivation and engagement on teaching 21st century skills.Research limitations/implicationsThis study is limited by the fact that the evidence relies solely on pre-service teachers' self-reporting. Secondly, although the hypothesised model explained 45.2% variance of pre-service teachers' competence in the 21st century skills, 54.8% of it remains unexplained.Originality/valueThe results of this study suggest important implications for teaching programs as they underscore the importance of digital literacy on epistemological beliefs, reading motivation and competence in teaching 21st century skills.

AB While teacher-as-methodology-researcher paradigm in the area of methodology is quite firmly established, teacher-as-language-researcher is less common, especially in teacher training programmes. Much less emphasis is placed on equipping teachers (especially non-natives) with skills of language analysis, hypothesis posing, data retrieval and analysis. The use of ready-made language corpora in preparing classroom data and creating materials is still inadequately covered in teacher training programmes, let alone putting future teachers in the shoes of linguistic researchers observing the changing face of English.
   The purpose of this paper is to present a case for promoting teacher-as-language-researcher attitudes in the graduate teacher training programme. A case study is presented, in which student teachers were gradually introduced into New Englishes, through existing corpora, text retrieval and compilation, and - finally - do-it-yourself concordancing. The data from questionnaires and teacher diaries will illuminate upon the viability of self-made corpus compilations as a part of 21st century digital literacy.

AB In later life, digital support is predominantly received outside of formal education from warm experts such as children, grandchildren, and friends. However, as not everyone can rely on this kind of informal help, many older adults are at risk of being unwillingly left without digital support and necessary digital skills. In this article, we examine non-formal digital support and peer tutoring as a way to promote digital and social inclusion through the acquisition of necessary digital skills. First, we ask: (a) What is peer tutoring, in the field of digital training, from the peer tutors' point of view? Then, based on the first research question, we further ask (b) what are the key characteristics of peer tutoring in relation to other forms of digital support? Our thematic analysis is based on semi-structured interviews (n = 21) conducted in Central Finland in 2022 with peer tutors aged between 63 and 84. Peer tutors offered individual guidance by appointment and also supported their peers in group-based settings. Based on our study, we argue that from the peer tutors' point of view, being a peer entails sharing an age group or a similar life situation and provides an opportunity for side-by-side learning. Although every encounter as a peer tutor is different and the spectrum of digital support is wide, these encounters share specific key characteristics, such as the experience of equality between the tutor and the tutee that distinguishes non-formal peer support from formal and informal learning.

AB This digital literacy initiative is an innovative program which aims to give prominence to adult learning from the educational practice point of view, in order to place the adult population in the core of that literacy process. This program is designed for adults with little or no knowledge on the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). It started from a basic knowledge on ICT in order to start computer training processes. The main objective of this program is to provide an opportunity for adults of the "Poligono Sur" neighborhood in Seville (Andalucia, Spain) to obtain new skills and competencies in order to take advantage of the different opportunities of the current society. The results obtained with the program were very positive even though we made changes and improvements in it. The main part of the adult participant achieved the learning objectives initially raised by the proposal.

AB Two trends in the developed world - the marked growth in the percentage of the population identified as "elderly", and an increased reliance on computing technology make it imperative that the high technology designers of tomorrow understand the challenges, capabilities and context of elderly users. Our graduate course on "software for senior citizens" provides a broad background of material from human-computer interaction, gerontology, literacy studies and cognitive and learning sciences. Students also gain first-hand experience through weekly tutoring sessions with local elderly residents. These sessions yield observations and generate contacts from which students generate research projects. This paper discusses our goals and motivations for the course, our experiences to date, and our plans for future iterations and opportunities for expansion.

AB E-learning has transitioned from mere retrieval of information to active participation of students who voluntarily engage in the learning process. As Riedel (2009) reported, Web 2.0 is about putting the power to learn and create in the hands of the students. Before the advent of Web 2.0, e-learning was primarily used to complement traditional pedagogical modes with an online component, whereas web 2.0 technology introduced new modes of learning, enabling greater reflection and discussion among learners as they construct knowledge online (Lau, 2012). Therefore at this stage, the role of digital literacy in e-learning is even more relevant. Digital literacy which refers to the effective and efficient use of web 2.0 technology to access and use the digital information needed for a variety of online tasks (Coiro, Knoble, Lankshear & Leu, 2008) should not be regarded as a separate set of skills, but instead embedded within and across e-learning activities and tasks. Although today's students have grown up around technology devices and most probably use these devices on a daily basis, they may not have necessarily have the digital literacy to appropriately use web 2.0 technology for constructivist e-learning activities and tasks. For this research, questionnaires were distributed among students in several universities across Malaysia to identify the digital literacy competencies of students for application in e-learning. Thus, this paper reports the findings of the study which aims to answer the following questions: (1) What are students' perceptions regarding their digital literacy competency? (2) How does digital literacy affect their e-learning with 2.0 technologies? The results revealed that even though students have high confidence in using Web 2.0 technology, they still lacked the digital literacy competencies needed to successfully accomplish e-learning tasks and activities.

AB Digital literacy is important because it is the underpinning influence that sustains an individual's competent and purposeful use of digital technology in education. Having digital literacy requires more than just the technical ability to operate digital devices properly; it also comprises a variety of skills that are utilized in executing tasks in digital environments, such as information skills, socio-emotional skills, cognitive skills and reproduction skills that the learner needs to master in order to use digital environments effectively. This research aim is to propose a learning process model to enhance digital literacy using critical inquiry through digital storytelling (CIDST). The research methodology was divided into two phases: the first phase involves document analysis and synthesis to develop the learning process model and the second phase involves evaluating the suitable learning model by experts. From the results, we anticipate that our learning process model could be used for reference on the part of teachers planning and implementing instructional activities to enhance the digital literacy of undergraduate students.

ID COMPETENCE
AB An efficient organization of the educational process within rapid acceleration of the society digitization is impossible without increasing its digital literacy, if the latter is really estimated and new models of digital learning didactics are developed respectively. So, it is necessary to study an actual state of digital literacy, as well as to search for and introduce new learning models in the educational system based on the use of modern innovative technologies and digital learning methods. The objective of the research is to examine the level of the digital literacy of teachers, and also opportunities and promising trends within the digital didactics for the formation of competencies as the basis of a new model for the development of a new learning model in the context of the formation of the digital knowledge society. Two main methods have been used - elaboration of the abstract and logical model and a survey. In the research the data obtained as a result of the survey conducted in 2018 by NAFI Analytical Centre related to the measurement of the digital literacy level of teachers and lecturers in Russia were used. The number of respondents made up 634 lecturers (higher education) as well as 555 teachers (general education). The digital literacy formation model was developed based on the didactic learning triangle taking into account the synthesis of three learning environments - real, virtual and neurocognitive. The analysis of the survey data demonstrated that in the aggregate of the compared indices for different social groups of the population, school teachers and lecturers of higher educational institutions have reached the higher level of the digital literacy, which significantly exceeds the average Russian level. So, in Russia as a whole the index of the digital literacy of the adult population by a similar measurement method makes up 52% out of 100% possible ones, school teachers - 87%, lecturers of higher educational institutions - 88%. The use of research results in practice is possible with the improvement of training programs, the exchange of international experience and further researches.

AB In this study, the influence of the application of an online teaching model on the development of digital cometences of future teachers in preschool institutions was examined. The research that this study deals with was carried out on a sample consisting of N=125 students of the 3rd year of basic academic and professional studies in the study program of teacher in preschool institutions. As a research instrument, a five-point Likert-type scale of attitudes was used. The results show that there is a statistically significant difference in the attitudes of future teachers in preschool institutions when it comes to self-assessment of digital competencies before and after the implementation of online classes during the state of emergency in Serbia during the Sars-Cov-2 virus pandemic. The conclusion of the study is that the implementation of online teaching in processing the content of the Methodology of getting to know the environment affects the improvement of the digital competences of future educators when it comes to: 1) creating digital resources; 2) application of digital technologies in immediate educational work; 3) the role of digital technologies in professional development. The results of this research can be used to encourage teachers to step out of the usual pre-pandemic practice and enrich their pedagogical work with combined teaching (hybrid model) where part of the material would be analyzed in person, and part would be analyzed online using web tools, websites and videoconferencing applications.

AB Digital literacy is a critical skill that administrative staff must acquire to continue their business activities at higher education. However, digital literacy studies for administrative staff seem to be neglected in the current literature. This article examines the impact of higher education administrative staff's digital literacy on their intention to use digital technologies while performing their tasks. For this purpose, a conceptual model consisting of effort expectancy and performance expectancy structures based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and expanded with the digital literacy dimension has been created. Data were collected from 158 participants who were administrative staff of two higher education institutions in Turkiye to evaluate the theoretical model. The data were analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The findings revealed the relationship between the digital literacy skills of higher education administrative staff and their intention to use digital technology. According to the results, digital literacy has a direct effect on effort expectancy but not on performance expectancy. Also, contrary to our expectations, digital literacy does not directly affect the intention to use. However, digital literacy affects the intention to use digital technology through effort expectancy and performance expectancy. In higher education, personnel with low digital literacy skills should be identified and in-service training should be provided. This is one of the first studies to address the impact of digital literacy on technology acceptance by administrative staff working in higher education.

AB Teacher educators should serve as role models in terms of information and communication technologies (ICTs) use to promote digital literacy of future teachers. To analyze the association between role modeling by teacher educators and preservice teachers' digital literacy and ICT integration intention in their classrooms, 185 physical education (PE) preservice teachers in the German federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg completed an online questionnaire of self-assessed technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) and ICT integration. The results of regression models revealed a positive association between content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge (PK) and overall intent to integrate ICT into teaching. The results further indicated that the impact of role modeling on preservice teachers varies depending on the chosen ICT. In this paper, we discuss the implications of these findings for higher education in general and for PE in particular.

There is a necessity of studying digital storytelling process with pre-service teachers. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of digital storytelling process on digital literacy skills of pre-service teachers and examine the creation process in details. The study was carried out with 36 computer education pre-service teachers. Digital literacy assessment scale, digital storytelling assessment scale and opinion form of the digital story creation process are the data collection tools of this study. Findings show that digital literacy levels of pre-service teachers differ significantly after the digital story creation process. Digital story assessment scale shows that digital stories got highlevel scores. Pre-service teachers? opinions show some difficulties in digital story creation process and highlight the positive contribution of the process of digital storytelling in educational settings.

When supported by analytics, this can be a productive way of engaging with the multisemiotic processes associated with digital literacy. However, when reappraised, corpora thus produced often play significant roles in contexts other than those for which they were originally envisaged. The final section of the paper reflects on video corpora's role in consolidating digital literacy in Higher Education as part of inter-university and cross-degree teacher-student partnerships.

AB Even though there is an abundance of research on computer supported education (CSE), digital literacy (DL), technological literacy (TL), and internet literacy (IL), the correlation between them and their effect on each other have not been analyzed in the literature. However, no study has been conducted on the correlation between and effect of CSE, DL, TL, and IL and which additionally explains their relationship to each other. This study aims to analyze the effect levels among the latent variables of DL, TL, and IL, and the attitude toward applying CSE and these latent variables' ratios to each other. For this purpose, eight hypotheses were developed after reviewing the literature. A relational descriptive model is used to detect the presence and extent of covariance. The participants of this study were 510 prospective teachers. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the scales were performed. The hypotheses of the research were tested with the structural equation model. As a result, it was revealed that DL, TL, and IL together significantly affect and explain the attitude towards CSE. Different suggestions have been developed based on the results of the research.

AB By bringing together studies dedicated to understanding the role of digital literacy in the empowerment of subalternized social groups and studies located at the interface between youth and adult education (YAE) and the Latin American decolonial perspective, this article aims to present theoretical indications, systematized through a literature review, which indicate the potential of digital literacy for the transgression of the coloniality of knowledge in the contexts of YAE. Coloniality of knowledge is a hierarchical structure that delegates the knowledge of subalternized social groups, of which YAE students are a part, to silencing or delegitimization. The conjunction of the potential of the YAE and its subjects for rebellion and empowerment through digital literacy reveals itself as a breach for the transgression of the coloniality of knowledge, aiming at transmodernity.

AB The pandemic has raised the students' activities in finding income, ranging from entrepreneurship to investing intention. This study aims to determine the role of economic education and digital literacy on student investment interest in universities during the Covid-19 period. In the analytical model proposed, it is assumed that the financial attitude variable is a mediating variable in education and financial knowledge in investment intentions. Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior and Bandura's Social Learning Theory was developed for the research model. The research adopted quantitative methods using survey research data from saturated sampling techniques. The participants in this study were students of Universitas Negeri Jakarta who are members of the Indonesian stock exchange investment gallery organization. From the 234 proposed questionnaires, 203 questionnaires were returned and filled out completely for data analysis. The study results confirmed the three hypotheses and rejected the four proposed hypotheses. Economic education affects student investment intentions and significantly affects financial attitudes. However, digital literacy affects students' investment intentions but fails to shape investment intentions through financial attitudes. Another finding is that economic education and digital literacy have no effect on shaping financial attitudes, but financial attitudes influence students' investment intentions during the pandemic.

AB Digital literacy does not have the long-standing tradition in academics that other curriculum topics have, e.g. Mathematics. This lack of long-standing tradition surrounding computing, and the current breadth of possible digital literacies, has given rise to many varied curriculum approaches at higher education institutions. Faculty, and other curriculum creators at Southern Utah University (SUU), are currently creating digital literacy curriculum that is both integrative, and focuses on just in time learning, but these curriculum creators struggle with determining proper digital literacy requirements that should be required of all students in a General Education (GE) curriculum. This paper records the approaches towards digital literacy found at SUU, its peer institutions, and other Higher Education Institutions in the State of Utah.

AB This paper analyzes the results of two consecutive years (2020 and 2021) of an international collaboration between students at universities in the United States and Romania from the perspectives of comparing digital competencies and future skills. Offered annually since 2009, TalkTech is a project based learning scenario requiring students to use synchronous and asynchronous communication tools to research a topic and share their findings in a jointly-created digital artefact. During the last two years, 110 students researched topics related to international businesses and creative industries and presented their results using virtual reality. To complete the project, students made use of open educational practices and communicated, analyzed, developed, demonstrated, shared compared and discussed their work using several different digital tools. This paper investigates how students perceive their use of digital tools how these influenced them, especially during pandemic times.

AB It can be argued that multimodal digital literacy practices promote the development of literacy skills needed for today's world without being constrained to one mode of learning. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the employment of multimodal practices during instruction within EFL classrooms in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is minimal and fraught with obstacles to its effective utilization. It is, therefore, important to determine whether this is the case and, if so, to develop strategies that would ameliorate this situation. This study, therefore, sought to identify KSA postsecondary EFL instructors' self-reporting of their use of various types of technology, computer software, and online software; the different teaching/learning and assessment strategies that they employ; the obstacles they face with the use of technology in their classrooms; and their beliefs about the use of multimodal digital literacy practices for teaching and learning. The study, which was based on the premises of social semiotic theory, utilized a mixed-methods design from which survey and focus group interview data were triangulated. The findings demonstrated that while most postsecondary EFL instructors have a strong positive attitude towards multimodal digital literacy practices and make robust use of specific types of technology and software programs, obstacles prevent these practices from being more widely and frequently deployed in the KSA. Suggestions for how to make a transformation to a more pronounced use of multimodal practices happen and the limitations to the study are also presented.

AB In recent years, teaching and learning practices have transformed greatly due to emerging technologies. Despite various pedagogical and technological innovations, the learning effectiveness of the new learning environments is still being debated. Systems thinking concepts and methods are needed regarding how to accommodate digital technology to optimize the efficacy of students' learning, especially when student cohort specificities are addressed. For the purpose of this study, we used an empirical research design supported by a bibliometric analysis. Multiple regression using dummy coding of the predictor variables was conducted to compare the prediction models across different groups of first-year students, while a sequential mediation model was used to examine the students' perceptions of systems thinking, engagement in the design course, and information communication technology (ICT) self-concept in relation to academic achievements. The results indicate that systems thinking centered around the understanding of feedback behaviors and causal sequences in the system has a direct effect on the design outcome and ICT self-concept related to problem solving and cognitive engagement, while, indirectly, systems thinking also mediates achievement in design courses. The ICT self-concept related to problem solving and cognitive engagement mediates the relationship between systems thinking and design course achievement. This study highlights the importance of leveraging learning system dynamics factors in diverse student cohort design courses and provides implications for developing a high-performance digital education sustainable ecosystem.

AB An increasing interaction between man and machine in all areas of society leads to not only new job profiles but also initiates a discussion about the needed digital competencies in the future. The European Commission's Joint Research Centre has developed an initial framework to describe the needed competencies such as problem solving ability, capacity of teamwork and programming skills [5]. It is expected that the transfer of technical, occupation-oriented and personality-building competencies alongside subject-related knowledge will become increasingly important in higher education [1]. In order to avoid inequalities among students-those with and without so-called digital competencies - new teaching methods are needed. In this regard, the following poster creates a new link between the DigComp 2.1 framework for citizens and making in higher education based on a literature review.

AB The purpose of this paper is to show the necessary competence sets for Higher Education (HE) lecturers in the framework of the COVID and post-COVID. A COVID-situated competence survey was carried out among university lecturers. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA, CFA) were applied to show the significant digital education competence factors. The representative online survey of 322 respondents shows that three big competence sets can be identified: Awareness, Professional, and Digital. Those having higher scores in Professional competencies foresee more digital programs and communications in the future, and not only the digital competencies but also the professional ones should be developed to meet the requirements of the digital education transformation process. The findings emphasize that the forced and drastic changes in the application of digital education to the intensification of COVID-19 should become sustainable and find its proper place and role in the future HE. The structured and closely managed use of the results was followed by a set of digital and professional competence development initiatives carried out within the framework of the Digital Education and Learning Support Centre, founded in 2020 at the University of Pecs.

AB With the rapid advancement of digital technology, artificial intelligence has ushered in a digital society. In this era, digital literacy has become a prerequisite for individuals, as its absence can lead to new vulnerabilities and inequalities, hindering the pursuit of sustainable development goals. Previous researches predominantly relied on questionnaires to assess digital literacy, often focusing on specific groups due to survey costs, making their methodology unsuitable for comprehensive countrywide measurement. To address these limitations, we propose FLAKE, a national digital literacy assessment framework. Within this framework, we devise a multi-task deep learning model called DLMaN, which employs mobile big data, such as users' digital behaviors, to predict citizens' digital literacy. FLAKE enables cost-effective assessment of digital literacy for massive citizens by surveying only a fraction of them and it also has valuable implications for other social research tasks. We test the framework's performance using authentic survey data and mobile big data, achieving RMSE and MAPE of 5.233 and 8.65% respectively, and the improvement is significant compared to the baseline model. We further employ this model to assess the digital literacy of numerous citizens in China and explore the implications for the society and individuals based on the obtained results.

AB Digital skills are increasingly required in all fields of the national economy. This has become especially relevant in the today's fast changing social developments and the recent unexpected conditions of pandemia. It requires also flexibility and innovation capacity of all involved stakeholders. The relevance of digital skills have been analysed by survey of vocational education managers, employers and students involved in work-based learning. The evaluation scale used was between 1-10 to ensure a more detailed comparison and analysis using indicators of descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations. Conclusions among other indicate that digital skills for employees are seen almost of the same importance as the ability to co-operate and loyalty to the company, according to employer's opinion.

Not only did the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impact the necessity of technology in our daily lives, but also reduced the availability of digital skills programmes. This study aimed to explore perceived facilitators and barriers of a digital skills programme that was delivered remotely (online) and to reflect on this form of training as a possible alternative to traditional face-to-face models. MethodsIndividual interviews were carried out with programme participants and the programme instructor. ResultsTwo themes were generated from this data: (a) Creating a unique learning environment; and (b) Encouraging further learning. DiscussionBarriers to digital delivery were evident, however, the individual and personalized delivery empowered participants within their own learning, supporting individuals to learn skills relevant to them and to continue their digital learning journey.

AB Having good digital skills is essential today, yet little is known about the cognitive factors that influence the development of these skills. Given the importance of executive functions (EFs) in adapting to environmental changes and acquiring skills, EFs might contribute to acquiring digital skills too. EFs might also influence people's approach toward ICTs and affect digital skills through emotional variables. Therefore, here, we tested whether cognitive control and flexibility are connected to computer and smartphone skills through emotional factors (learning confidence, stress, and attitude). A total of 269 participants (56 males, M = 30 years) filled out our survey which included questionnaires on demographic variables (age, education, and socioeconomic status), ICT motivation, digital skills, EFs, and technology-related emotional factors. EFs were also investigated through two performance-based measures. We used generalized linear models and structural equation modeling to test the associations between these variables. The results showed that smartphone skills were positively associated with self-reported cognitive flexibility through ICT learning confidence and technology-induced stress. Self-reported cognitive control and age were connected to smartphone skills directly. Self-reported cognitive flexibility was also associated with computer skills through ICT learning confidence. In addition, performance-based cognitive control and the level of education were directly linked to computer skills. These results may provide guidance to support digital skills and create digital skill training.

AB There has been a long tradition of demonstrating formal education's direct relationship with many dimensions of development, including increased productivity, health, reduced mortality, population control etc. There has also been a literature looking particularly at the democratic dividend' from education, both through the lens of global citizenship as well as more generally through education's influence on political participation. The successful securing of global citizenship education (GCE) within the ambitions of Sustainable Development Goal 4.7 in September 2015 was a further milestone in connecting social development with democracy, good governance and the rule of law'. Accordingly, there are many telling examples of how GCE can be rolled out in school curricula, through many different school subjects, across the world. Arguably, however, the formal school system is far from being the only location where messages about citizenship, whether global, national or local, can be found. During the period, 2016-2019 in the USA and UK, with the huge rise in smart-phone usage world-wide, it has become apparent that there can be massive micro-targeting, through global platforms, of selected populations with multiple messages about citizenship, national identity, job security, migration threats, potential terrorism and a great deal else. Unlike the citizenship curricula and textbooks of formal schools which are easily accessible, a great deal of this new social media messaging is relatively inaccessible, using procedures that are a long way from traditional electioneering. They are also much less financially accountable, but it is clear that vast sums are now being spent on social media advertising, presenting an existential threat to democracy. The role and level of education in reacting critically to social media campaigning will need to be revisited in this new world of campaigning around global and national citizenship. It is no longer a discussion about education's positive relationship with increased political participation, but whether current education levels are actually capable of dealing with the current threats to citizenship, at global, national and local levels.

AB Technological changes have reshaped communication, social life as well as the conditions of work, challenging schools to foster skills and capacities that help youth to competently and confidently navigate these new socio-technological terrains as workers, citizens and private individuals. Responding to these changes, media and digital literacy have been at the centre of a global policy push to articulate a curricular plan for twenty-first century skills, resulting in numerous frameworks produced by non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations and adopted by national governments. At the same time, scholars have been critical of the overwhelmingly economic rationale behind twenty-first century competencies and of the influence of global edu-business on national education policies, calling for critical analyses that examine the local uptake of globally mobile policy initiatives. This paper investigates media and digital literacy at the nexus of global twenty-first century education initiatives and their local interpretation within Singapore's education system, with special attention to the role of creative digital production. Drawing on a critical analysis of both international and Singapore policy, as well as empirical data on teacher and student practice, I highlight the selective process of localization and its impact on twenty-first century competencies in Singapore.

TI DIGITAL LITERACY IN HIGHER EDUCATION: A CASE STUDY OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT

AB Aim/Purpose This paper reports on a case study project which had three goals; to develop a suite of original interactive digital skills e-tutorials to be embedded in undergraduate and postgraduate courses; to evaluate the students' experience and engagement with the e-tutorials over one semester; and to explore their general attitudes towards online and blended learning.
   Background Online and blended learning modes continue to grow in popularity in higher education, with the aim of streamlining and enhancing student learning, supporting collaboration and creativity, and equipping students with the skills they will require to work and live in an increasingly digitized world. This practice-based case study highlights factors which positively and negatively affect user engagement with digital learning objects and explores students' perceptions of the role of online learning within their academic programs.
   Methodology A suite of nine interactive e-tutorials, addressing essential digital literacy skills for university students, was developed through instructor and student peer collaboration using Articulate software, informed by best practice. The e-tutorials were embedded in the institutional Learning Management System for three undergraduate and postgraduate courses, in which digital literacy formed the core learning content, to complement classroom-based learning. Students in these courses were surveyed via SurveyMonkey about their specific experience of using the e-tutorials, as well as their general perceptions of digital literacy and online learning. Eighty-six students in total completed the questionnaire, which consisted of twenty-three closed-and open-ended questions.
   Contribution Through highlighting both the positive and the challenging aspects of the students' reported experience of online learning, this case study contributes useful insights to the body of literature on user engagement with digital learning objects in higher education, as well as students' perceptions and experience of blended learning.
   Findings The e-tutorials were perceived as valuable in reinforcing classroom learning, allowing respondents to revise concepts and materials covered in face-to-face classes, at their own pace and in their own time. Survey responses showed that the accessibility, ease-of-use, design and duration of the e-tutorials were deemed effective in terms of user engagement; however, several technological challenges were identified, such as browser incompatibility, uneven sound quality and general Internet connection issues, which disrupted their learning. Overall, students expressed enjoyment of the learning facilitated by the e-tutorials; however, rather than favoring online learning alone, they expressed a preference for a blended learning environment, with a combination of complementary learning approaches; survey respondents did not generally wish to forego face-to-face classes entirely.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Instructors should seek to strategically embed interactive digital learning objects in their courses at defined points of need in a logical structure, e.g., to reinforce classroom-based learning, or to support specific skill development. Potential disruption to learning should be minimized by following best practice guidelines to ensure ease of access, a seamless user experience, and timely feedback, as well as providing adequate support for rapid resolution of technical glitches.
   Recommendations for Researchers E-tutorials offer a useful means of exploring ways in which students acquire learning in the digital environment. A wider, collaborative exploration is needed to provide comparative studies which move beyond case studies.
   Impact on Society Online learning mechanisms, such as e-tutorials, offer students different means of acquiring essential literacy skills and different ways to interact with content. E-tutorials constitute reusable learning objects, which can be accessed as just-in-time delivery modes, when students perceive they need to review particular skills or reinforce learning material.
   Future Research This research is now expanding into different types of reusable learning objects. E-tutorials may be developed in multiple ways, and comparative research around e-tutorial models will deepen our understanding of how students interact with content in formal learning contexts. As the digital educational landscape continues to expand alongside traditional face-to-face and analogue learning modes, a key research focus will be student and instructor perceptions and experience of blended learning in different contexts.

AB Digital literacy has been a popular research topic in the areas of library and information science, computer science, and education. Whereas emergence of the pandemic further facilitated the exchange of these fields. This study investigated scholarly articles about digital literacy over a 4-year time span and tried to depict the future research trends in higher education after the pandemic by employing the method of science mapping and visualizing to identify the prospective themes. Through analysing the collected data, results indicated that studies of digital literacy in higher education during the pandemic mainly focused on the application, evaluation, and challenges of digital literacy faced by students and teachers, but there were other themes from the perspectives of pedagogy, psychological well-being, and equity that will be addressed more in future studies. The findings of this study provide a further understanding of research trends and are beneficial for practitioners to gain insight.

AB Background Globally, digital skills are a crucial aspect of education that schools should develop systematically. Research on digital skills tends to be measured using self-reports, performance tests or interventions. There is less knowledge about student and teacher uptake of technology in school, making it important to investigate the actual use of technology and digital skills in authentic classroom settings. Objectives This study contributes unique baseline data concerning students' use of technology and digital skills across mandatory English courses in real classroom settings in secondary schools in Norway over time. Methods The study adapted a national framework for digital skills into an observation protocol. With it, this study analysed videos from 60 naturally occurring English lessons in 13 English classes at seven lower secondary schools over two school years (grades 9 and 10), following 186 students (aged 13-15) and 10 teachers. Results and Conclusions Students used digital skills critical for education in half of the video-recorded English lessons, with more digital skill use at some schools over time. The main finding across classrooms and school years regards students' use of basic, not advanced, digital skills. Takeaways Although teachers provide opportunities for students to use digital skills in school, more advanced skills are needed. This work calls for continued use of video recordings to provide systematic comparisons of potential shifts in students' digital skills in real English secondary classroom settings over time.

AB This paper addresses an analysis of contemporary, structured, and connected pedagogical approaches to the teaching of digital proficiency/fluency in 21st-century digital literacy. We present a proof of concept and epistemological valorisation of digital literacy previously underestimated. This epistemological valorisation focuses on teaching digital literacy through understanding how teachers work - pedagogical planning, teacher training, syllabus design, practical work - enabling us to train technology producers instead of passive technology consumers, to enable agents instead of clients. The term "digital" will refer to 21st-century digital literacy. To "think digital" will refer to the mental process carried out by digital natives when conducting operations involving ICT - as their native language and framework. The pedagogical background is paramount to the structures underlying teaching of 21st-century digital literacy, characterised by its disruptive building process achieved through the acknowledgement of epistemological foundations. High school teaching of 21st century digital literacy is by no means at ground zero. The fundamental concepts to be conveyed remain the same: electric coding, input and output devices, memories, processors and transistors - the process/system is just faster and smaller. The development of a proof of concept was built according to a DSR framework, in an iterative way, giving evidence of architecture configuration, an asset of information, of tools, procedures, and attitudes.

AB In recent years, the government of Kenya has implemented programs with the hope of moving the country to middle-income status. The government has implemented the Digital Literacy Programme, distributing tablets to schools across the country, and also a new curriculum, promoting innovative teaching that includes digital literacy, learner-centered teaching, and relevance to students' lives. Our purpose in this research was to explore culturally sustaining teaching methods in line with the Kenyan government's push for innovative teaching and digital literacy attainment for all students. We used case study methods to describe Kenyan teachers' perceptions of innovative teaching and digital literacy while participating in the Inquiry Initiative, a three-day professional development series. Participants included preschool, primary, and secondary teachers from Trans Nzoia County. Data sources were pre- and post-surveys, participant-generated artifacts, and interviews. Our participants perceived the following needs: new literacies for learners, creativity for learners, collaboration and group work, and creativity to overcome technological challenges. Overall, participants embraced learner-centered teaching theoretically but found that the lack of technological resources created barriers to teaching digital literacy in a learner-centered fashion. We found that teachers reported mostly using technology for teaching preparation and record keeping rather than engaging students in digital literacy practices. To solve technological challenges, teachers described having students work in groups and using smartphones. Future research could share more creative solutions to technical challenges in low-income countries.

AB The general objective of the study was to determine the relationship between digital skills and teaching performance in professors of the industrial engineering career at a private university in Huancayo, while the specific objectives were: to determine the relationship between information and information literacy and teaching performance; determine the relationship between communication and collaboration and teaching performance; determine the relationship between the creation of digital content and teaching performance; determine the relationship between information security and teaching performance; determine the relationship between problem solving and teaching performance. The approach was quantitative, with a non-experimental design, applied type and correlational level. The population was 215 professors from a private university in Huancayo, with intentional non-probabilistic sampling, resulting in a sample of 35 professors from the industrial engineering career. A questionnaire with 24 questions was used, with five response options according to a Likert-type scale. From the descriptive field, the absolute and relative frequencies were calculated to determine the level of perception. From the inferential field, the normality of the data was determined and subsequently the correlation coefficients were calculated with Spearman's Rho test.

AB In the modern era, talent cultivation plays an essential role in the transition process to sustainable development. The emerging direction of talent cultivation is intended to achieve global competence in computational thinking and digital literacy; however, there is still a gap in Taiwan. Scholars and educators have identified the contents of digital literacy, which include statistical concepts, data analysis skills, and critical thinking. To fill this gap, this study proposed an innovative educational teaching method that integrates data visualization techniques and critical thinking training to improve students' decision-making literacy. An experiment on the curriculum with a one-group pre-test and post-test design was conducted for 79 participants. The data consisted of a geographical data map, visualized data diagrams, and a statistical test; the scores for critical thinking, academic self-confidence, and academic performance were separated into high, middle, and low achievement groups. For data analysis, the bootstrapping method (resampled 1000 times), paired sample t-test, and ANCOVA were applied for data analysis to compare the difference between each independent group. The results showed that the post-test scores (statistic test M = 9.59, infographic test M = 6.09, map test M = 5.02) were higher than the pre-test scores (statistic test M = 7.15, infographic test M = 3.46, map test M = 3.13). The most significant implication is the innovative teaching approach based on integrated data visualization and critical thinking. It plays a very significant role in enhancing decision-making abilities.

AB The assessment of digital skills and competencies required to make use of digital resources poses several challenges. In order to evaluate the current situation and trends, this research study initially presents a review of history, existing trends and digital competence frameworks, learning and teaching methodologies for digital literacy and provides insights and recommendations. The review of existing framework and methods used to assess digital skills of different groups has revealed that self-assessment is an assessment category that most often results in an overestimation of own digital skills by respondents. To address such deficiencies, a digital competency model (DigComp) was created in 2013, as part of the EU Education and Training Agenda 2020. This model describes which skills and competencies are needed to use digital technologies in a confident, critical, collaborative and creative way and to accomplish the goals related to work, learning, and leisure in a digital society. Starting from the existing framework, this research study devises a conceptual model to support teaching and training. Each user group requires a different approach in order to accurately evaluate their digital competences; therefore, the use of a flexible and integrated approach is necessary. The model proposed in this study describes which skills should be learned, how they should be taught, and how they can be assessed.

AB This study aims to analyze students' digital literacy in the context of learning biology material on the digestive system and identify students' digital literacy in terms of interest in digital technology, internet costs, gender, and learning outcomes. The research was conducted at the one private high school in Medan, Indonesia. The instrument used is a questionnaire and a list of student grades from the teacher. The results showed that students interested in digital technology had a significantly higher digital literacy score than students who had less interest in digital technology. There was no significant difference in digital literacy between groups of students with internet fees < US$ 14 per month and students with internet fees of US$ 14 per month, and between groups of male and female students. The results of the analysis also found a positive correlation between learning outcomes and digital literacy.

AB The existence and use of technology can be a means of maximizing the potential of students' thinking abilities, including the ability to solve problems. Learning that utilizes cellular technology that contains material in science-math stories becomes one of the ways of utilizing technological developments in learning activities. The study used a pretest-posttest control group design with more than one experimental group. There were two experimental groups from two schools that experienced learning with science-math stories based on digital learning as digital literacy media, and one control group from another school who carried out literacy activities using reading books in the class and the library. The use of science-math stories based on digital learning as a digital literacy media can improve problem-solving skills for elementary school students. The main content in the form of realistic fiction illustrated stories with adventure themes that raise environmental problems to be solved becomes the main strategy in improving the ability to solve the problems of elementary school students.

AB The development of individuals' digital skills has received much attention as a remedy for digital inequality. Although some researchers favor courses and guided learning for skills development, others propose learning by trial-and-error. Unfortunately, studies examining the value of the so-called "do-it-yourself approach" for the development of digital skills remain lacking. One difficulty lies in the vicious circle of lack of skill leading to infrequent Internet usage and vice versa, which limits the value of cross-sectional data for assessing the impact of this approach. We present longitudinal data on a random sample of Internet users in a Dutch city, which show that more frequent Internet use leads to more digital skills, but not the other way around. However, contrary to expectations about the potential of trial-and-error learning to reduce inequality, results also suggests that this approach is not always more beneficial to the "have-little" as compared to the "have-more." The only inequality-reducing effect of this approach is that that older users profit more from it than younger users do.

AB This research delves into the examination of the correlation between service learning and critical digital literacy among preservice preschool teachers in Taiwan, with a particular emphasis on the role of online social capital. The survey took place in Taiwan with preservice preschool teachers who willingly completed a questionnaire. Initially, there were 416 data samples for further statistical analysis. This study utilizes literature reviews and theoretical reflections to examine the observed variables and factors in the "Service Learning and Critical Digital Literacy Scales" (SLCDL) questionnaire. To assess these aspects, a Chinese questionnaire is used, covering "service learning", "critical digital literacy", and "online social capital". Using partial least squares analysis, researchers investigate the intricate interplay of online social capital in shaping the nexus between service learning experiences and the advance of critical digital literacy competencies. These results showed that service learning increased critical digital literacy among preservice preschool teachers, and online social capital played a mediating role in this relationship between service learning and critical digital literacy. We should actively encourage preservice preschool teachers to increase their critical awareness by understanding vulnerability and experiencing reality from the perspective of community partners. In addition, we need to provide more service learning opportunities that incorporate online social capital to enhance their critical digital literacy.

AB Digital literacy is needed for digital transformation. It is challenging to provide an appropriate digital literacy lesson for all people to satisfy their different goals. Therefore, the proper way of teaching and learning digital literacy requires personalized learning. Nowadays, the ethnic minority group can have equal access to a vast opportunity from the Internet through the smartphone. However, the Internet can also be harmful to them without proper protection. Therefore, it is necessary to promote digital literacy for them. This study proposes a smart learning environment for enhancing digital literacy of Thai youths from the ethnic minority group. The proposed smart environment modifies the objective distance, which is the distance between the satisfied and the current competency of each learner, for providing a personal learning path. There are 5 learning objects included. The experiment is conducted with 103 students who are the ethnic minority group in Chiang Rai province, Thailand. The comparison of post-test and pre-test reveals that the students can enhance their digital literacy after learning with the developed learning environment. Overall, the students agree on the provided personalized support. More specifically, they strongly agree that the provided content is suitable for their performances.

AB Digital literacy, a prerequisite for online learning, is fostered by active engagement with technology, a concept that is explained by self-determination theory (SDT). This two-study project took the unique opportunity afforded by COVID-19 to explore the effect of technology learning support for SDT-needs satisfaction on digital literacy and the possible mediating effects of needs satisfaction on the relationship between perceived support and digital literacy. In Study 1, 63 Grade 10 students undertaking online learning were randomly assigned to groups that were either given or not given the support. Study 2 further explained the effect of the support by needs satisfaction, and involved 309 Grade 10 students to complete a questionnaire. The analyses showed that the positive effect of the support on digital literacy, and needs satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between perceived support and digital literacy, suggesting that autonomy and competence are more important than relatedness in developing digital literacy.

AB As digital multimedia devices increasingly pervade people's lives, including the lives of older adults, the need to provide relevant training for these age groups grows. Older adults, not due to their frailty or age, often find it difficult to use digital devices like smartphones, and they often lack the basic digital literacy required to use multimedia interactive devices with touchscreen technology. This is the major reason why they are experiencing the sharp digital divide in the twenty-first century. In this study, older adults from four European countries participated in a two-phase process: playing interactive games on a large touchscreen tablet and learning how to use a smartphone to access digital services. The attitudes and the difficulties associated with adopting the skills to operate the device and use the digital services were observed and discussed. The findings and recommendations for an effective approach to this problem are discussed at the end of the paper.

AB This study aims to investigate the challenges, efforts, and demands faced by Korean elementary school teachers responsible for lower-grade students in developing digital literacy skills during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of remote education. It also aims to provide support strategies to enhance teachers' digital literacy. Through a comprehensive analysis, the study identified five components of teachers' digital literacy: (a) understanding and utilizing technology tools and digital media; (b) exploring and managing information and data; (c) digital ethics and safety; (d) relationship building; and (e) teaching and evaluation. A semi-structured interview methodology was then employed to uncover the challenges, efforts, and demands experienced by teachers regarding their digital literacy.The study's findings are categorized based on the components of teachers' digital literacy and lead to four recommendations for enhancing their digital literacy. First, creating a supportive infrastructure and environment that encourages teachers to prioritize their digital literacy improvement is crucial. Second, providing diverse training programs, manuals, and tailored guidelines for each component of digital literacy is essential. Third, fostering collaborative support networks among teachers, both online and offline, to facilitate information and resource sharing is vital. Lastly, considering a long-term perspective, integrating digital literacy-related content into the curriculum for pre-service teacher preparation is recommended

ID INFORMATION LITERACY
AB Information communication technologies and media have challenged traditional education and changed teachers' thinking. These technologies present unique opportunities for supporting creativity, which is the key aim of learning in arts education. Despite the direct and close link between them and arts education, how to integrate these technologies into traditional education has long challenged government and educational experts. Teachers' digital literacy has been regarded as an important part of information communication technologies-enabled education. Because an arts education uses more equipment than other types of education, it is more dependent on digital media. Thus, arts teachers' digital literacy has directly affected their teaching, and has played an increasingly important role in education. This paper, having investigated eight Chinese arts teachers' digital concepts and utilities in their teaching, explores digital literacy in arts teaching in China from different perspectives. It also offers recommendations for research into arts teachers' digital literacy and arts education research in China for the future. Overall, this study designs a framework of factors for Chinese arts teachers' digital literacy.

AB The development of cryptocurrencies has altered traditional economic institutions and financial inclusion. This study investigates the complicated relationships between education, digital literacy, cryptocurrency views, and financial inclusion in virtual economies, addressing a key gap in comprehending the disruptive dynamics of emerging financial technologies. Undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students from private universities in Delhi NCR were polled using a standardized questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale. According to the study, higher education boosts digital literacy, cryptocurrency opinions and financial inclusion. Although education is critical for financial inclusion, the link between positive attitudes about cryptocurrencies and financial inclusion remains uncertain. As virtual currencies expand, these results urge policymakers and educators to concentrate on digital literacy and positive attitudes in order to promote inclusive financial ecosystems.

AB This paper presents the process of co-design, co-production, piloting, evaluation and revision of an Integrated Digital Literacy and Language Toolkit for Vulnerable Migrant Students (VMs) in Higher Education (HE). The language element focuses on academic language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking required for effective involvement in both the host society and HE learning; the acquisition and improvement of digital literacy skills enable VMs to successfully participate in, and contribute to, university and societal collaboration, creativity and content curation. The Toolkit resulted from the co -operation and collaboration of five EU universities and was based on the ASSURE instructional design model. The Toolkit offers a self- access, self- paced, non-linear, fully online set of ten stand-alone units which offer a range of materials and activities to develop those skills pertinent to VM academic language and digital literacy needs. Evaluation by a group of VMs resident in EU countries highlight the positive impact of the Toolkit and validates the instrument as fit for purpose. Noteworthy aspects include its usefulness in supporting student autonomy, improving digital capabilities and academic language mastery,a positive experience of a flexible learning experience along with access to open resources of international scope and dissemination under the Creative Commons licence.

AB In today's world, specific skills are essential for success in work and life. Educators, governments, and industry leaders recognize collaborative problem-solving (CPS) and digital skills as necessary for the 21st century. However, our current understanding of these skills' interconnection and development within technical and vocational higher education remains limited. This study aims to achieve two main objectives. First, we want to examine the level of digital skills among technical and vocational higher education students in Chile and how it relates to their socioeconomic background. Second, we aim to investigate how students' different levels of digital skills influence their satisfaction with online collaboration and their assessment of group processes after completing an online CPS task. The study identified three distinct groups of students based on their digital skills: high-skilled, medium-skilled, and low-skilled. The low-skilled group faced more socioeconomic disadvantages compared to the other two groups. Moreover, students with low digital skills reported lower satisfaction with online group work and a poorer selfevaluation of the group processes involved in the collaborative online task. Insights for technical and vocational higher education institutions to foster targeted support of digital skills development for their student body are discussed.

AB The incessant changes in technology generate new products and services, presenting multiple opportunities for the complex educational environment. Consequently, higher education institutions must be attentive to these changes to ensure that students have the knowledge and skills necessary for the work environment. This research aimed to identify studies related to digital transformation and digital literacy in higher education institutions through a systematic study of literature. The search resulted in 830 articles published in the Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2015 to 2022. Quality questions, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied where 202 articles were selected for the study. The results show (a) interest of educational institutions in empirical studies where technologies are incorporated for didactic purposes, (b) challenges of opportunity in training programs to develop digital competences of teachers and students, (c) little interest in the development of media literacy, (d) the methodological aspects of the studies allow exploring new perspectives of digital transformation in higher education. This article may be of interest to academics, decision-makers and trainers of future professionals to introduce educational technology into learning processes in line with the complex demands of the world of work and society.

AB One of several scientific disciplines' significant objectives is to determine the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the academic setting. This research studies the use of ICTs, especially the Internet, by university students in Hispanic countries. The methodology used is descriptive and quantitative, based on data mining, through a validated and highly reliable instrument. The sample was composed of students from six countries (N = 1893). The results show that the primary interests in using ICTs and the internet are primarily for consuming social networks, obtaining information, and leisure, above and beyond their use for academic and university purposes. This indicates that there is still a lack of sufficient training for the optimal use of these technologies by higher education students. It is urgent to carry out digital literacy processes that allow them to develop a critical sense in using ICTs, nowadays configured as powerful means of communication. Furthermore, this study has been determined that the Hispanic common space has solid cultural roots and everyday practices that lead to quite similar general interests.

AB Social media platforms have become significant media for participating in society. This, and society's digitalization overall, has resulted in concerns regarding access and inclusion. By combining theories of social media participation and digital inequality, we explore issues regarding the prerequisites of participating through social media platforms, focusing especially on education. Through an analysis of data from a representative survey study in Finland (N = 3724), we illuminate the ambiguity of the perceived obstacles to both digital skills and political participation. We further build on the concept of digital capital to show the significant mediating effect of digital skills on education and participation. By utilizing the ISS (Internet Skills Scale), we break down digital skills into operational, information navigation, social, creative and mobile skills, and show how the operational skills have most significant mediator between education and political participation in social media. In studying digital inequality, we claim that the concept of digital capital is a valuable tool to illuminate the mechanisms for overcoming digital divides through the transaction of other forms of capital into digital capital, and digital capital to other forms of capital, in this case political capital.

AB Digital Humanities pose a field of research, teaching and creation of great challenges. When disciplines such as art history are projected in preservation, study and dissemination of Cultural Heritage, the main obstacle in the current times may be the lack of mastery of digital skills that allow effective use of the tools that are available to global citizens They, in their double role of info-citizens and cyberactivists, require adequate training to beneficially impact on cultural heritage. Art History could play a leading role if it assumes the use of digital tools such as Google Arts & Culture, thus embracing the potential of Digital Humanities on whose site it could be registered. Proper information management, including its effective dissemination, is vital for the protection of cultural heritage. That is why the benefit that can be obtained, on the grounds of the disciplines traditionally associated with the study and dissemination of cultural heritage, from the digital tools available is very valuable. Analyzing the possibilities of Google Arts & Culture from the perspective of Digital Humanities would open a bouquet of possibilities for the new global citizen who is in the search for participation channels that may allow him to express himself, connect and get to know the world around him better.

DT Article
AB This paper proposes a new approach for combining top-down and bottom-up approaches intended to lead to a curriculum for action in the public interest that builds on social entrepreneurship and digital skills for students at community colleges. This integrated approach requires a collaborative, participatory approach and aims to provide relevant content for students with different cultures and backgrounds, personal values, and sense of identity. The objective is for all participants to engage in the learning process, become more confident, and develop contemporary skills that inspire and enable them to take initiatives to tackle global challenges and to thrive in a multicultural world. A relevant curriculum must enable students to understand the global and local situations in different geographies and, with the increasing demand for digital skills, to access and share information over networks, to develop possible solutions, and to make them happen. This paper proposes ideas for stimulating students to think about what they can do for the public good, starting with local issues, and to generate outcomes valued by the community. The ideas proposed for specific local communities in Maryland can be generalized for understanding and addressing problems for different communities in the United States as well.

AB The context of virtual education requires not only the availability of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), but also the development of digital competencies that will mediate the teaching and learning processes. These digital competencies and the development of autonomy are established as transversal competencies in the National Curriculum of the Peruvian Ministry of Education. In addition, it is in this context that it is urgent to evaluate the digital competencies of students. For these reasons, the present study aims to analyze diagnostically the level of digital competencies in primary school students in Lima-Peru. The sample consisted of 118 students (67 females (56.8%) and 51 males (43.2%), 71 (60.2%) from fifth grade and 47 (39.8%) from sixth grade. A scale assessing 5 digital competencies was applied, which evidenced adequate levels of reliability (alpha = 0.83). Finally, the results showed that the students have optimal levels of development of digital competencies, but in the exploratory analysis, 2 students were identified with difficulties in the digital content creation competency and 2 with difficulties in the digital security competency.

DE digital literacy practices; digital literacy skills; early learning;
   home; parent mediation; young children
AB BackgroundIn today's society, a growing body of literature attests to the importance of young children's early digital literacy skills in their home environments and how acquisition of these digital literacy skills relates to their future learning and digital literacy.ObjectivesResearch on young children's digital literacy practices at home was reviewed to explore the positive and negative influences on early learning. This is important due to the children's rapid uptake of online digital technologies over the past decade.MethodsPeer-reviewed research articles on home digital literacy practices of children (aged 0-8 years old) published between 2010 and 2021 from four education databases were carefully selected based upon pre-determined criteria and examined using content analysis.Results and ConclusionA high proportion of studies (29 of the 31; 93.5%) demonstrated significant benefits of young children gaining a range of skills, including digital operational, early literacy and language, socio-emotional, and STEM, through the use of digital technologies at home. Five of the 31 (16.12%) studies reported negative effects of digital technologies in the home context, including distraction, aggressive behaviour, and false self-confidence. Tablets and smartphone use gained greater momentum in the home context, especially between 2015 and 2021, and there was a positive shift in parental mediation, family involvement, and the children's home digital literacy practices.ImplicationsBy leveraging children's acquisition of digital literacy skills in the home and taking into account the sociocultural context, we can enhance young children's preparation for the future and provide opportunities for skill development across various learning domains.
   What is already known about this topicImplications for practice and/or policyThe literature shows use of tablets in the home by children have gained momentum.Parents have different attitudes towards using digital technologies in the home context.Parents have used different mediation strategies to control, supervise and support their children's home digital literacy practices.What this paper addsWithin the past decade, parents have extended their mediation strategies to support their children's home digital literacy practices.Young children move from early digital literacy to proficient digital literacy within the home.Home digital literacy practices can foster important skills in young children such as language and literacy, operational, socio-emotional, and STEM.Artificial intelligence devices such as smart robots are extending children's home digital literacy practices.Understanding the sociocultural differences of young children can help parents, teachers, and policymakers to facilitate digital literacy skill acquisition.Fostering young children's basic language literacy, operational, socio-emotional, and STEM skills through technology use in the home before formal education is essential.Extending young children's home digital literacy practices to other contexts such as the classroom is necessary.

AB Background: Digital technology is a social determinant of health that affects older people's ability to engage in health maintenance and disease prevention activities; connect with family and friends; and, more generally, age in place. Unfortunately, disparities in technology adoption and use exist among older adults compared with other age groups and are even greater among low-income older adults. Objective: In this study, we described the development and implementation of a digital literacy training program designed with the dual goals of training low-income older adults in the community and teaching students about aging using a community-engaged learning (CEL) approach. Methods: The training program was embedded within a 10-week CEL course that paired undergraduates (N=27) with low-income older adults (n=18) for 8 weeks of digital literacy training. Older adults and students met weekly at the local senior center for the training. Students also met in the classroom weekly to learn about aging and how to use design thinking to train their older adult trainees. Both older adults and students completed pre- and posttraining surveys. Results: Older adults demonstrated increased digital literacy skills and confidence in the use of digital technology. Loneliness did not change from pre to postassessment measurements; however, older adults showed improvements in their attitudes toward their own aging and expressed enthusiasm for the training program. Although students' fear of older adults did not change, their comfort in working with older adults increased. Importantly, older adults and students expressed positive feelings about the trainee-trainer relationship that they formed during the training program. Conclusions: A CEL approach that brings together students and low-income older adults in the community has a strong potential to reduce the digital divide experienced by underserved older adults. Additional work is needed to explore the efficacy and scalability of this approach in terms of older adults' digital literacy as well as other potential benefits to both older and younger adults.

AB The widespread of personal computers and the availability of Internet connections have been the core modern-day educational tools that aid teaching and learning, and enhance effective interaction between students and their lecturers. However, despite the appreciable level of recognition of mobile learning as a new innovative educational model in the country, there exists a wide research gap as a result of implementation and adoption. This study examines the behavioral intention of lecturers towards mobile learning and the moderating effect of digital literacy in Saudi Arabian universities. A total of 420 respondents was conveniently sampled, and a structured questionnaire was designed, administered, and analyzed using SPSS (R) 23 and PLS-SEM software. The results obtained showed a direct and significant relationship between all the variables with behavioral intention. It revealed that mobile literacy showed the highest contribution, followed by facilitating conditions, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. However, only years of experience was negatively related. The result of the moderation showed that mobile literacy, moderated with facilitating conditions. Basic ICT literacy is negatively moderated with facilitating conditions and positively moderated with learning expectancy. Based on this outcome, it is recommended that universities can design a policy that will facilitate the enhancement of digital literacy, particularly mobile literacy among lecturers by building their capacity on the use of mobile learning tools for research, teaching, and learning.

AB This longitudinal quasi-experimental mixed methods study examined the potential of employing a gamified problem-based learning (hereinafter: the intervention) to increase digital literacy (DL) skills and creative self-concept among undergraduate students. The first step of the study was used to develop and validate an efficient measure of students' perceptions of their DL skills. Step 2 was employed to check the research hypotheses by a quasi-experiment interventional study design. To this end, data were gathered from two groups: research and control (which has not experienced the intervention), both groups were Education students. Participants' perceived DL skills and creative self-concept (CSC) were surveyed twice - before (pretest) and after (posttest) a three-month intervention. Lastly, qualitative data were collected and analyzed (Step 3) to better understand the quantitative data results. Results revealed significant differences between the pre/post tests only for the research group on the DL and CSC factors - the scores at the posttest were higher than the pretest. Non-significant differences were indicated between the tests for the control group. Results also indicated significant low to moderate connections between the DL and CSC factors. The qualitative data analysis revealed four main categories pertaining to DL skills; technology-enabled collaboration; perceived creativity; and transfer of knowledge and skills.

AB Science and technology is very rapidly growth in the current era of globalization. With the ease of disseminating information both print media and the internet, knowledge and technology development is increasingly fast. The development of science and technology is increasingly advanced, allowing humans to live in an industrial climate by maximizing the functions of technology to replace the humans' roles. When science and technology increasingly allows humans to produce advanced technologies, the digital technology progresses allow humans to live in information society. A concept that generally explains how the community in relation both information and communication activities is facilitated by the modern products ability as the internet supporting by computer products. Computer is the tool that can facilitate and explore the human capabilities in learning and processing information. Thus, the advancement of information technology can affect a person's life in tracking information. Based on the previous elaborations, the writer concern on the current study entitled "The Effect of Digital Literacy on Entrepreneurial behaviours through Entrepreneurial Intention of Students in Economic Education Study Program in Jember". Hopefully, the world of education in both general and higher education can take the roles in contributing the entrepreneurship from the cognitive, affective and psychomotor for students, so students have entrepreneurial behaviours. This study aims to examine empirically the causal relationship between two variables, namely digital literacy (computer literacy and internet literacy) on entrepreneurial behaviours, and entrepreneurial intentions. This study is explanatory research to find and explain causal relationships between variables. Besides, this study is conducted to answer the problems that have been formulated, the objectives to be achieved, and to test the hypothesis. This study was survey methods by distributing questionnaires to obtain information and the approach is a quantitative approach. The data analysis was Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis. Based on the results, it was found that the digital literacy of students in economic education study programs in Jember was still limited to influence the intention of entrepreneurship, especially on entrepreneurial behaviours. However, the intention of entrepreneurship is proven to mediate digital literacy towards entrepreneurial behaviours. Therefore, the writer suggested that learning is more effective and can be more meaningful for students, preferably focused on both practical and theoretical. Based on the interview results, the proportion of practical learning activities is only around 30% and the theory is 70% of learning. These conditions should be reversed, precisely 30% of theory and 70%, practice especially the practice of entrepreneurship with digital media, for example e-commerce, including the practice of marketing strategies in the marketplace, market space, social media, e-mail, and others.

AB The article highlights the results of an experimental study on the formation of future educators' digital skills. The national and international approaches to defining the nature and content of digital skills, use of ICT for their formation are characterized. The European Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu) was analyzed in six areas of activity (professional involvement; digital resources; teaching others and self-study; rating; empowering students; promoting the digital competence of education providers) in order to identify digital skills needed by modern educators. Five digital skills that form the basis of future educators' digital competence (use of digital devices and ICT; search and critical evaluation of digital content; modification and creation of digital resources; information exchange and organization of digital communication; learn and teach to use ICT) have been singled out and criteria and indicators of their formation have been identified. The levels of development of future educators' digital skills were determined, using the 100-point scale by the expression of indicators, namely: unsatisfactory level (20-59 points); satisfactory level (60-74 points); good - (75-81 points); very good (82-89); excellent - (90-100 points). The results of studying the levels of formation of digital skills of future elementary and pre-school teachers at the ascertaining stage of the study showed the need to develop technological tools for their formation. The scientific paper presents the author's training program "Designing a multimedia environment of general secondary education and preschool education" with the use of ICT. Comparative analysis of the results of the ascertaining and control stages of the empirical study conducted during 2018-2020 at the Pedagogical Institute of Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University, showed a positive dynamic of levels of students' digital skills and proved the effectiveness of the implemented technological tools. The statistical significance of the study results was verified using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

AB The era of globalization and media presents new opportunities for a comprehensive study of various aspects of social life, including a large field of social sciences as education and pedagogical sciences. The mentioned factors and a number of descrepancies served as the starting point for studying the problem of developing a system of digital skills and media education within the organization of environmental education of preschool children and the formation of ICT competence of teachers. Modernity witnesses harmful technogenic influence of human activity on the natural world, which leads to a global crisis in the relationship between man and nature. At present, the Russian Federation is experiencing a new digital impulse, which entails research into the impact of information and media technologies on the sociocultural and educational activities of all participants of educational relations.
   Thus, the purpose of the article lies in theoretical justification and experimental verification of new methodology as an integrated system of environmental education of preschool children and the formation of ICT competence of the pedagogical corps of a preschool organization. To achieve this goal, the authors used a set of methods: theoretical (analysis of scientific literature on the research problem; summative methods (studying and generalizing the experience of specialists working in educational organizations); experimental methods (observation, interviewing, pedagogical experiment, etc.). In addition, the article compares and discusses different domestic and foreign researchers' results on environmental education of preschool children and the ICT competence of teachers. The results of a study conducted on the basis of 10 preschool organizations in the Moscow region are presented and commented in detail. The research directions of the development of the problem of environmental education and ICT competence of teachers in the new digital media reality are presented. The results of the study allow us to find a solution to the pedagogical tasks of the innovative organization of environmental education of preschool children, taking into account the effective formation of the ICT competence of teachers; and also open up new vectors for the research in the context of systemic changes in education and digitalization.

AB With the spread of online education, many studies highlighted the crucial role of digital literacy in second/foreign language (L2) learning. However, the influence of such a competency on L students' perceived emotions has remained under-research. To fill this lacuna, this study used a quantitative design via three questionnaires to investigate the predicting role of students' digital literacy (DL) in their perceived enjoyment and online learning self-efficacy (OLSE). To do so, a sample of 987 Chinese English as a foreign language students, at university level, were invited to partake in the study. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrated that DL could predict about 95% of changes in the participants' FLE (beta = .949, p < .001). Furthermore, it was found that about 92% of changes in Chinese students' OLSE could be significantly predicted by their DL (beta = .916, p < .001). Drawing on the obtained results, the study presents discussions and implications for L2 educators regarding the role of digital literacy in students' perceived emotions.

AB The current study examines the relationship between digital competencies and collaboration attitudes among higher education students. To do so, data from 1316 students from 10 Spanish universities were analyzed and collected through a questionnaire named "Basic Digital Skills 2.0 of University Students" (COBADI (R)-Registered Trademark: 2970648). To provide context for the sample involved in this study, it is noteworthy that 50.5% of participants typically prefer to access the internet from home. Furthermore, it was observed that most of the respondents engage with the internet for over nine hours daily. The analysis of the results was conducted by calculating correlations between digital competencies and students' collaboration attitudes. These correlations were computed using the Python programming language, with the libraries employed being pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Students who perceive themselves as more competent in using digital tools tend to have a slightly higher disposition to collaborate with their professors in virtual environments. Some competencies are more closely associated with collaboration than others, with those that exhibit a stronger connection being key focus areas in teaching and curriculum development.

AB Taking courses by continuing education (CE) providers is one of the main ways for adults to learning digital skills. CE is provided in either face-to-face (F2F) or online distance learning (ODL) mode. While F2F courses are natural and well-understood, ODL is flexible and less expensive. However, ODL lacks the natural teacher-student and student-student interaction. It is important to find out the factors that affect the adult learner's preferred learning mode for gaining digital skills. This study examined these factors by modifying the Unified Theory Of Acceptance And Use Of Technology (UTAUT). The authors modified the UTAUT by adding the reputation of the provider (RP) and price perception (PP) as moderators. The data from an online survey involving 125 adult learners was analyzed using Smart PLS 3.0. It was found that among the four original UTAUT constructs, social influence is not related to the attitude towards the preferred learning mode. Furthermore, RP has a significant moderation effect on the Performance Expectancy, and Effort Expectancy. Lastly, PP affects the Facilitating Conditions. The implication for CE providers is that they should try to maintain a good reputation for their CE courses. In particular, for MOOC platforms, the providers should have more courses that are created by professional bodies or universities. Interestingly, the adult learners perceive the price as an indicator of facilitating conditions. Hence, the provider should charge their courses that reflect the quality of the infrastructure of, and the support for, the technologies used in delivering those courses. (246 words).

AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have considerably increased the information and communication channels, favoring the emergence of new models for social relations, such as social networks. However, for elderly users whose learning has traditionally been based on linear models of information such as textbooks, unfamiliarity with Internet can be a barrier. Moreover, elderly people living in rural communities face a lack of telecommunication infrastructures, which increases their difficulties in accessing ICTs. The aim of this study is to test a social network consisting of multiple applications with linear navigation as a digital literacy method for the elderly in rural areas. A sample of 46 participants between 60-76 years old with heterogeneous previous experience with ICTs participated in the study. They performed eight standardized sessions in an Elderly Leisure Center. Results showed differences in perceived usefulness between users with high and low ICT experience. After eight training sessions, the majority of the participants were able to independently use all the system applications, and positive results were obtained on the variables measured, i.e., learnability, sense of control over the system, ability to use the system, orientation, efficiency, accessible design, perceived ease, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. The participants with previous experience with other ICT methods preferred the linear navigation method because they thought it was easier than other ICTs. The results showed interaction differences when touch screens were used. Qualitative results showed that one of the most frequent emotions at the beginning of the ICT sessions was "fear" (related to breaking the computer or to making fools of themselves), but the continued use of the system improved the users' perceptions of their own capacity to handle ICTs and their interest in ICTs in general. The main contribution of this work consists of exploring the usefulness of linear navigation and social network systems in the context of digital literacy for elderly users in rural areas.

DE Digital genres; English Language Teaching; Digital Literacy
AB This paper discusses the use of digital genres and social networks in the context of English Language Teaching (ELT) through two teaching experiments in which the genres e-mail and microblog (also categorized as a social network, as seen in Orihuela, 2007) were used with a total number of 15 pre-intermediate students of English in Brazil, in 2009, as their main source of communication outside the classroom over a period of 6 teaching months. Digital genres and social networks can be regarded as powerful resources for enhancing interaction and for developing communicative competence, as they provide opportunities for practicing writing within specific genres and working on communicative strategies and appropriateness, thus raising genre awareness. Moreover, as Harmer (2001) adds, learning a new language also involves being aware of the different ways/situations in which language is used. The use of e-mail and microblogs as a basis for communication outside the classroom incited a more responsive attitude from learners, who engaged more frequently in communication using the target language. Learners also became more aware of language use and appropriateness, and the use of microblogs provided them with the opportunity to actively position themselves regarding a number of topics, thus taking part in the world of digital communication. The use of digital genres in ELT was paramount in fostering digital literacy as students interacted in the digital world and voluntarily started using online dictionaries, search engines, etc. throughout and after the experiments

AB Second Language (L2) Digital Literacy is of emerging importance within English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Korea, and will evolve to become regarded as the most critical component of overall L2 English Literacy. Computer-based Internet-hosted Learning Management Systems (LMS), such as the popular open-source Moodle, are rapidly being adopted worldwide for distance education, and are also being applied to blended (hybrid) education. In EFL Education, they have a special potential: by setting the LMS to force English to be used exclusively throughout a course website, the meta-language can be made the target L2 language. Of necessity, students develop the ability to use English to navigate the Internet, access and contribute to online resources, and engage in computer-mediated communication. Through such pragmatic engagement with English, students significantly develop their L2 Digital Literacy.

AB This study investigates the most dominant factors influencing Indonesian students' listening meta-cognitive strategies. The interaction of digital literacy skills research instruments and learning styles can improve the students' meta-cognitive strategies in listening skills. The role of digital literacy skills research instruments and learning styles is to enhance students' listening meta-cognitive strategies with a total sample of 242. This study uses quantitative research by applying the ex-post-facto method. Analysis of research data using descriptive and inferential statistics with a linear regression test. The results demonstrate that the pupils' digital literacy skills had the most dominant impact. The regression results disclosed that the R-value of the influence of the literacy variable on the meta-cognitive listening strategy was 0.468, meaning that it had an effect of 46.8%, while the learning style was only 19.20%. The interaction between digital literacy skills and learning styles could improve the students' meta-cognitive listening strategies, approximately by 50.40%. Digital literacy skills and learning styles have a positive role in improving students' meta-cognitive listening strategies. A student's meta-cognitive listening technique improves as his or her digital literacy skills and learning style improves.

The instrument used has been a Likert scale questionnaire, adapted and validated by experts from the participating universities. Its internal consistency demonstrates its worth and functionality for the proposed analysis (alpha = 0.958). The first results show a clear lack of knowledge of certain technological concepts essential for their future teaching work and, in turn, show significant differences regarding the knowledge of ICTs according to the age of the participants.

AB Recent civilizational transformations have led us to search for and introduce new didactic solutions. One of these is e-learning, which is a response to the needs of the education system and its individual stakeholders. The e-learning systems currently available offer similar solutions. Only during direct interaction with a given tool can one notice significant differences in their functionality. By carrying out evaluation studies the indicators that determine this functionality can be identified. The paper presents e-learning in the context of the academic training of the future generations of teachers. The reflections revolve around digital literacy and experience in using modern information and communication technologies in education. The goal of the research was to evaluate three areas: the functionality of the SELI platform, individual experiences with e-learning, and digital literacy. The technique used was an e-learning survey appended to the end of two e-learning courses offered on the platform. The survey was addressed to teachers and students of the biggest pedagogical university in Poland. The general impression of the content presented on the platform was, in most cases, rated as being very good or good. The platform itself was also evaluated positively. Based on the analyses conducted, two groups of platform users were identified. One third of the users have diverse experiences with e-learning, which corresponds with their digital literacy. The remaining two thirds of the respondents need more training in the areas evaluated. The authors of the paper believe that this type of study should accompany all activities that introduce e-learning at every stage of education. Only then will it be possible to discover where the digital divide lies among the teaching staff and learners.

The aim of playful learning was to promote preschoolers' multiliteracy and digital skills in a news-making project. The participants were 17 preschoolers and their teacher. Video ethnography and qualitative content analysis were employed as research methods. The findings indicate that the teacher's motivational scaffolding strategies in playful learning pedagogy included connecting with the preschoolers' prior experiences and interests, promoting exploration skills, supporting the different developmental levels of the preschoolers, and encouraging them to participate in playful learning. The following motivational triggers were identified for preschoolers: 1) engaging in discussions about news, 2) exploring news through traditional and digital media, 3) utilizing digital tools, and 4) creating and engaging in news-related activities. The findings contributed to the development of a motivational design model for playful learning.

AB For the world of education, including students, instructors, and policymakers for adoption of digital literacy has now become a key concern. Teachers must be aware of the importance of mastering digital literacy in the learning experience. After the Covid-19 epidemic, this research intends to examine educator knowledge of the application of digital literacy in the learning process. The study employs a quantitative descriptive technique to carefully review the types of teacher digital literacy awareness, supportive factors in the usage of digital literacy, and the consequences of tutor computer literacy recognition following the Covid 19 epidemic. The research process was conducted in the Islamic Public Senior High School (MAN) in Palembang, Sumatra. The consistent findings indicated that positive' competence of digital literacy was significant in terms of their capacity to use technology about 100%. The most influential supporting factor correctly is the motivation of friends (97.90%). The implication of using digital literacy for teachers is the execution of virtual meeting learning (94%). The logical conclusion of this study is that teachers develop awareness in utilizing technology, and it is more effortless to convey material after the Covid-19 pandemic. Mastery of digital literacy for teachers needs to be carefully reviewed to the stage of performance and application to students.

Statistical analyses included Cronbach Alpha, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman's rho correlation, and the Generalized Linear Model (Logit Model). The majority of participants were female (65.6%), aged 21 or older (85.2%), and in their 4th grade of study (35.2%). There were no significant differences in PCS scores concerning gender, age, grade, type of residence, and residence location (p > 0.05). However, PCS scores were significantly higher among those who listed dentistry among their top five preferences, expressed high satisfaction with education, and demonstrated high professional interest (p < 0.05). A significant, positive correlation was observed between PCS and RSES (r = 0.398; p < 0.01), DLS (r = 0.404; p < 0.01), preference (r = 0.120; p < 0.05), education satisfaction (r = 0.298; p < 0.01), and occupational interest (r = 0.502; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the Logit Model analysis revealed that RSES (B = 0.290; p < 0.01), DLS (B = 0.258; p < 0.01), education satisfaction (B = 0.806; p < 0.05), and occupational interest (B = 3.825; p < 0.01) significantly influenced PCS. The findings underscore self-esteem and digital literacy's integral role in shaping dental students' perceptions of their professional abilities. Digital literacy is a substantial pillar supporting students' professional competency. Coupled with a genuine interest in the field and bolstered self-confidence, digital literacy proves instrumental in enhancing students' academic success in dentistry. By emphasizing and expanding upon digital literacy content within the curriculum, universities can further propel advancements in the dental domain. As such, it is pivotal for dental institutions to weave strategies into their educational fabric to elevate students' self-esteem and digital proficiency.

AB This paper contributes to the conceptualisation of digital literacy as a social practice. While previous studies have focused on student digital skills and digital practices in well-resourced environments, there is a research gap concerning digital literacy as a social practice in resource constrained environments, such as South African universities. A qualitative approach is used to explore the acquisition of discipline-specific digital literacy practices by a purposive sample of three first-year students from two extended degree programme courses. The findings reveal that the discipline-specific learning and assessment activities instantiated students' digital literacy practices in the technical, cognitive, and social-emotional dimensions. Furthermore, the participants acquired digital literacies in the technical and cognitive dimension. The research findings provide insight to how other higher education educators in developing contexts could integrate digital literacies into course curricula as a means of building students' capacity on discipline-specific digital literacies.

AB Compatible with global sustainable development report, 2016 edition, and vision 2030, Saudi Arabia recognized the importance of technology in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper aims to measure the self-perception of digital skills among students in Saudi Arabia's higher education system to understand how they were influenced before and amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, we started a project to study the self-perception of digital skills among Saudi Arabia university students (group A). A total of 469 students participated in this research. The validity and reliability of the employed scale were tested with first-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The differences between the two groups (before and amid the pandemic) were tested through the Mann-Whitney U test. The results for group A (N = 232 students) showed a higher self-perception of their digital skills. In March 2020, amid the pandemic, Saudi Arabia closed and shifted to technology-based teaching like many other countries worldwide. After students' return to universities in 2021, an evaluation of how the students perceived their own digital skills was again conducted (group B). The results for group B (N = 237 students) demonstrated a lower level of confidence in their own digital abilities. Comparing two groups (A and B), after the educational course was administered, group A (prior to COVID-19) had greater self-perceptions of digital skills than group B (amid COVID-19). Students' perceptions of their own digital skills have been negatively impacted as a result of the pandemic situation caused by COVID-19. The collected evidence suggests that there is a difference, and that this difference is statistically significant. As a result of the substantial relationship between self-perception of digital skills and how students deal with reality based on their own self-perception, Saudi Arabia higher education ministry shifted teaching methods to be based on technology. Other significant findings and their implications for practice and theory were reported in this study. Finally, limitations and prospects for future research were also elaborated.

AB This study explored the degree of teachers' centrality in the classroom while developing digital literacies of their students and the pedagogical strategies which are employed by teachers in this process. We conducted a bottom-up analysis on 65 semi-structured interviews (n = 4372 statements) based on two conceptual frameworks: the Digital Literacy framework and the 5Cs framework with a nation-wide sample of elementary and secondary-teachers. The findings offer a typology of four teacher prototypes regarding the degree of their centrality in a technology-enhanced classroom and the mapped pedagogical strategies employed by each prototype. Based on bottom-up coding, the study expands the above-mentioned frameworks regarding re-production thinking, socio-emotional thinking, e-communication, and collaboration literacies. We discuss the implications for educational theory and practice.

AB Web 2.0 Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) have been proposed as a new method to promote the use of Web 2.0 tools for learner-centered personal learning. However, few studies have examined students' attitudes toward Web 2.0 PLEs or, more specifically, the factors influencing students' positive attitudes or willingness toward Web 2.0 PLEs. This study investigates the effects of self-regulating capabilities (e.g., metacognition and time management), tool literacy, and information literacy on preservice teachers' attitudes toward using Web 2.0 for constructing their PLEs. Participants included 137 undergraduate students in education at a large Midwestern university in the United States, who completed a survey focused on: (1) attitudes toward building a Web 2.0 PLE; (2) metacognitive self-regulation; (3) time and study environment; (4) tool literacy; and (5) information literacy. Results indicated that tool literacy and metacognitive self-regulating capabilities had predictive effects on preservice teachers' attitudes regarding building PLEs with Web 2.0 tools. The findings of this research offer meaningful implications for researchers and educators about which essential competencies need to be fostered before students are asked to build their own Web 2.0 PLE.

AB As international benchmark studies on the digital literacy of prospective teachers with respect to their educational status can only be of limited significance in a federalized educational landscape, it is necessary to conduct regional and subject-specific studies using a survey instrument that is suitable for the relevant target group in order to provide specific training.For this purpose, the competencies of 185 prospective physical education teachers were surveyed at the beginning of the teacher training period in Baden-Wurttemberg (response rate 44.4%). This was based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) model using an online questionnaire on self-assessment and considering subject-specific content-related issues. The results show that the prospective physical education teachers feel well-prepared in terms of content (CK) and better prepared than pedagogically (PK) for an increasingly digital educational environment. They also feel confident in conveying content knowledge in a pedagogical manner (PCK), although the consideration of information and communication technology (ICT) in the classroom (TK, TCK, TPK, TPACK) still represents a barrier. Specific support for the pedagogical implementation of ICT (TPK) may have a positive influence on TPACK, also in an interdisciplinary context.In addition, the further research on TPACK should take into account the subject-specific nature in order to identify possible deficits and to be able to work constructively on them in the sense of target-oriented education. In this way, the teaching of theoretical knowledge should focus more strongly on the school context. Training with respect to movement skills should concentrate even more on technological aspects in the methodological integration in order to be able to effectively promote TPACK for prospective physical education teachers.

DE Techne; technique; Vedic traditions; and Indian Senior Citizens
AB Most commonly held views on digital literacy (DL) impose a set of prescriptive notions of skills fixed in time and place. These views essentialize DL on the bases of "expert knowledge" and "best practices" theses, fiercely compromising the context-driven idea of user knowledge derived from improvisation and intuition. By examining a group of Indian senior citizens, the study argues that creative appropriations of the Internet and computer enabled technology (ICET) demystify the standard view of DL and reconceptualize the relationship between 'end' and 'means' of technology as relative rather than categorical. To this end, the study situates techne, defined as creative skills residing within users, within the ritual mode of communication. In the context of India, the framework is embedded in the traditional Vedic ideals that exert tacit but powerful influences on the appropriation patterns of Indian senior citizens. Using mixed method research (MMR) to examine the ICET appropriation by senior citizens, the study shows that not just the social secular context influences how we use technology, but the metaphysical traditions inherent within a cultural framework can also impact and motivate users' response to technology. Therefore, ICET can be a powerful site where the contemporary and the tradition converge.

AB The rapid development of digital technologies and their increasing application in many areas of everyday life challenge all citizens to continuously learn digital skills. This also applies to older adults, among whom digital literacy is on average less well-developed than among younger adults. This article investigates why retired older adults participate in opportunities to learn digital skills. Multiple case design with both qualitative and quantitative methods was used to include the views of older adults from Austria, Finland, and Germany. The results of this interdisciplinary study indicated individual, social and technical reasons for their participation in digital skills training. Practical implications and recommendations for future studies are suggested.

AB Background: To build complex digital skills and capability required by digitally-driven work environments, we must first understand nursing students' baseline digital literacy if educators are to develop a fit for purpose curriculum underpinned by digital health technologies.
   Objective: To determine first-year pre-registration nursing students' perceived baseline digital literacy before their first clinical placement.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Settings: Two universities in Australia in 2020.
   Participants: Students enrolled in pre-registration nursing programs at Bachelor's and Master's level.
   Methods: Participants (N = 205) completed an online 27-item survey composed of a Likert-type scale, forcedchoice items, and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics.
   Results: Participants engaged with digital technology early in life, with 49.75% students using some form of digital technology before ten years of age. Students reported the highest daily use of technology to search the internet for information (92%), online social networking (68.3%) and watching videos (67%). Most students expressed the least confidence in identifying different types of portable storage devices (24.1% Master's students; 41.7% Bachelor's students), describing the advantages of a digital camera (39.3% Master's students; 48.3% Bachelor's students), and totaling numbers in spreadsheets (22.8% Masters students; 48.3% Bachelor's students). No statistical differences were observed between the two universities or the two cohorts in terms of perceived confidence in using technology and software applications to support their learning. Interestingly, 24.7% of participants expressed high confidence in using electronic medical records without prior training, which may reflect positive attitude towards engaging with unknown digital technologies.
   Conclusions: Nursing students are frequent internet and social media users. However, despite positive attitudes to digital technology and widespread presence of digital technology in students' lives, deficits in students' confidence in using digital technology and software required for learning persist. Targeted digital literacy education interventions are needed as part of foundational nursing studies to improve nursing students' baseline digital literacy before commencing clinical placement. These should be scaffolded across the program to ensure an effective transition to nursing practice in evolving digitally-driven healthcare environments.

AB Entrepreneurs need early access to information to seize the opportunities offered by the economic environment and avoid threats that could undermine their businesses. In the age of the internet economy, speed of access to information is dependent on the young entrepreneurs' mastery of technological tools that promote access to the right information at the right time. The skills in digital literacy in terms of selection, interpretation and knowledge construction and also in terms of communication and insertion in the digital culture are essential to face the competition and to be competitive. The role of education is important here to prepare literate entrepreneurs.
   By conducting a qualitative study using a focus group technique with entrepreneurship students at the Tunisian University level, we aimed to deeply explore: (1) the familiarity of the students with Digital Literacy, (2) students' perception of the knowledge acquired through their education programs and if it seemed to them sufficient compared to the competences that they perceived as necessary for their future job as entrepreneurs. The results show that the concept and the skills it contains were a discovery for the students. The focus group was also an opportunity for students to collectively reflect on their training and their ability to launch themselves as future entrepreneurs.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Most people from rural and township areas in South Africa do not have skills in utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), particularly those who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive.

AB BackgroundIn Ethiopia and other developing countries, electronic medical record systems and other health information technology are being introduced. However, a small proportion of low-income countries have successfully implemented national health information systems. One cause for this can be the lack of digital literacy among medical practitioners. As a result, this study aimed to assess health professionals' digital literacy level and associated factors in Northwest Ethiopia. MethodA quantitative cross-sectional study was employed among 423 health professionals working in a teaching and referral hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. We modified and applied the European commission's framework for digital competency to assess the level of digital literacy among health professionals. We used stratified random sampling with proportional allocation to the size of the departments in the hospital to select study participants. Data were collected using a semi-structured, self-administered, and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive and binary logistic regression analysis techniques were used to describe respondents' digital literacy level and identify its associated factor, respectively. The odds ratio with 95% CI and value of p were used to assess the strength of the association and statistical significance, respectively. ResultsOut of 411 participants, 51.8% (95% CI, 46.9-56.6%) of health professionals had adequate digital literacy. Holding a master's degree (Adjusted OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.18-3.85), access to digital technology (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.12-3.17), having training in digital technology (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.05-2.59), and having a positive attitude towards digital health technology (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.68) were found to be significant factors associated with health professionals digital literacy level of health professionals. ConclusionLow level of digital literacy among health professionals was observed, with nearly half (48.2%) of them having poor digital literacy levels. Access to digital technology, training on digital technology, and attitude toward digital health technology were significant factors associated with digital literacy. It is suggested to increase computer accessibility, provide a training program on digital health technology, and promote a positive attitude toward this technology to improve the deployment of health information systems.

AB The emergence of ICT in the current landscape has had a huge impact on education in recent years, especially in language teaching. This digital teaching approach has gained momentum since students are the protagonists of their learning process. This change implies a renewal of the methodological approach to foreign language teaching. This study aims to provide an overview of the impact of phraseology teaching in classes of Russian as a foreign language with the use of ICT on the acquisition of communicative, inquiry and digital competencies of the participants of the present study carried out at the Center of Slavic Cultures of the University of Granada. For the analysis of the data of this intervention, a qualitative study was designed using a reflective diary as a data collection tool to evaluate the achievement of these competencies. The results show that, although teaching phraseology can be challenging for students, it favors the development of different communicative subcompetencies, inquiry competence, and digital competence.

The interest is focused on quantifying the level of development reached by teachers in pedagogical mediation and digital competences both allow them to face technological and communication changes to integrate them into learning processes and thus apply a set of skills in the elaboration of didactic materials; this research is of a qualitative approach of the non-experimental exploratory type. The questionnaires showed the level of maturity of the teachers and the opportunities for improvement in the continuous training in the disciplines of technology, communication and pedagogical mediation. The collection of the data established those elements that reflect the quality in the elaboration of the didactic materials, it also establishes the skills required in the teachers under the distance modality. The positive results allow compliance with the scope of the guidelines of the strategic plan related to promoting teacher training, the development of digital materials with academic activities mediated by ICT, for hybrid subjects or 100% virtual in the Moodle institutional work platform.

AB Previously, we described a self-directed learning with knowledge management (SDL-KM) model (Silamut and Petsangsri 2020), to motivate learners in an organization to learn from internal-and-external knowledge management resources to enhance their Academic Achievement and Digital Literacy Abilities. In this paper, we aimed to demonstrate the value of this model by comparing these abilities in a controlled experiment with employees of an energy regulatory organization in Bangkok, Thailand. 40 employees were randomly selected, using stratified sampling, and divided into an experimental group (20) and control group (20), who participated in learning activities on two energy topics. The research instruments were data collection at the end of the lessons, which included information on Academic Achievement and Digital Literacy Ability assessment. Means, standard deviations and one-way MANOVA statistics were computed. As the results, the experimental group had higher Digital Literacy Abilities than the control group (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the groups for Academic Achievement. SDL-KM model encourages learners to learn by themselves, knowing how to use Digital Literacy Abilities to support KM. This will lead to success in their work.

However, limited research addresses the practical challenges of involving undergraduates in creating of Web-based assessment platforms. This study investigates the effects of this process on students' learning outcomes and their psycho-emotional experiences, focusing on motivation and engagement. A comparative study involving 156 students revealed that those using the Kahoot! platform achieved significantly better learning outcomes and displayed higher motivation and emotional engagement than those using Google Forms. This also highlights the role of interface design in improving Web-based assessment platforms, with implications for user interface design.

AB Any undergraduate student lacking the knowledge and skills for digital technology will find it challenging to succeed academically and thrive in the 21st -century higher education setting. This study employed a novel conceptual framework built from ecological theory to investigate the attributions of the knowledge and skill gap in digital literacy among Ghanaian undergraduate students. A phenomenological qualitative design with a purposive sampling technique was implemented to collect data from 16 undergraduates in a large public university in Ghana in a four-months period. The findings show several factors responsible for students' digital literacy knowledge and skills gap. Undergraduates have ascribed these reasons to various macro and micro factors. The students attributed their skills gap to personal, parental, institutional, and government factors, pointing to the need for concerted action from national and international policymakers and educators alike. This paper argues that university lecturers, administrators, the Ministry of Education, and policymakers in Ghana should collaboratively redesign comprehensive, persuasive, and integrated digital literacy approaches to benefit undergraduate students at all levels.

AB This study compares the digital literacy of people with and without disabilities in Korea, using data from the 2011 Information Divide Index Data of the National Information Society Agency (NIA). We extracted Internet and smart device users from the NIA samples and examined the main effects of disability, gender and age, as well as their interaction effects on Internet and smart device use and production literacy. Of the 1500 public individuals examined, 1190 (79.3%) were Internet users and 535 (35.7%) were smart device users. Of the 5300 with disabilities, 2110 (63.9%) were Internet users and 324 (8.8%) were smart device users. Generalized linear modelling showed significant main effects of disability, gender, age and education on Internet use and production literacy. The disability x age and disability x education interaction effects on Internet use literacy were statistically significant. We also observed a significant disability x age interaction effect on Internet production literacy. However, the main and interaction effects of disability, gender and education on smart device use and production literacy were not significant.

AB The proliferation of new forms of technology and specifically Web 2.0 and Internet technologies has undoubtedly affected every aspect of our lives and none more so than in education. Increasingly Web 2.0 tools and eLearning is promoted within schools, colleges and universities with concepts such as cloud computing, bring your own device (BYOD) and bring your own technology (BYOT) being considered viable options for enabling students and educators to integrate technology into their education.
   As a result of these developments educators are being asked to pay greater attention to the digital literacy of students and to ensure that students are prepared and able to use technology competently. However whilst much focus is placed on the student use of technology less attention has been paid to the digital literacy of academic staff.
   Academic staff will often be integral in selecting the manner in which information is presented to students as well as the manner in which students are required to complete and submit work. Therefore whilst students may wish to utilise web technologies for their education it is unlikely that if academic staff do not understand or engage with such tools that students will be given the opportunity to fully engage with these technologies within their studies.
   It is within this context that this paper considers the degree to which the digital literacy of academic staff may be an issue within UK Higher Education (HE). This is undertaken through the analysis and discussion of primary research undertaken amongst the staff within a UK based HE institution.
   This paper considers the degree to which academic staff have engaged with web based technologies and general IT within their daily lives and within teaching practice. This research suggests that staff are familiar with web based technologies and are engaging with such tools within their daily lives but do not have the confidence to utilise these within their teaching practices particularly as students are expected to already be very familiar with such technologies.
   This paper provides a research model in which the factors that may influence the degree to which academic staff feel confident in utilising web based technologies within both their personal lives and for teaching and learning can be tested.

AB This study explores the effects of pre-service teachers' digital literacy and self-efficacy on their perception of AI education for young children in early childhood education settings. Digital literacy refers to the ability to communicate with others by using digital technology, including the ability for sharing knowledge and information after user's creation. A survey was conducted on 212 pre-service early childhood teachers at two Universities located in the eastern United States, and the collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hierarchical multiple regression. As a result of the study, first, pre-service teachers had high critical thinking among the sub-factors of digital literacy, but relatively low problem-solving skills. Second, the relationship between digital literacy, self-efficacy, and the perception of AI education for young children showed a positive correlation. Third, among the sub-factors of digital literacy of pre-service early childhood teachers, technical application, learning interaction, and problem-solving with teachers' self-efficacy were found to have a significant effect on the perception of AI education for young children. This study proposes that developing a pre-service teacher education program that can improve their digital literacy and self-efficacy is necessary for guiding early childhood teachers to use artificial intelligence technology with young children in early childhood education classrooms in educationally meaningful ways.

AB Nowadays it is important that students and teachers have a good digital education in order to be able to teach and receive different contents through digital platforms. In this sense, this article aims to analyse the Pedagogy course at the State University of Ceara (Brazil) and to give a voice to the different agents who participate in it in order to find out about their training in terms of digital competence and face up to their learning in a virtual educational modality. To this end, various instruments were used from a case study, applied to 23 students. The results showed little knowledge about the use of ICT before the start of the blended learning course and revealed that the students' precarious economic conditions prevented them from accessing a computer with internet at home, which had a negative impact on academic education. Furthermore, that students are aware of the need to master ICT in the teaching of distance education (DE). It is concluded that DE students in the UECE are not well trained to interact successfully and that tutors need continuing education in digital education. To close the study, compiling the contextual analysis, a SWOT matrix is proposed.

AB Many studies have investigated inequalities in coping with stressful life events and often education is found to play a role in this (the higher educated are usually more successful in dealing with their problems in terms of well-being consequences). We examine whether something similar occurs on the Internet, whether the higher educated are more successful in mobilizing help online, and whether this is related to their digital skills and the way in which they use the Internet. With the latter, we link online coping to digital inequality research. Researchers have investigated digital inequalities with regard to skills and types of Internet use. However, we know little about the extent to which these factors translate into inequalities in resources mobilized from the Internet. This latter type of inequality is highly relevant, since it is an intermediary step between Internet use and (improved) wellbeing and life chances. Using a large sample of individuals living in the Netherlands, we find educational differences in the mobilization of online problem-focused coping resources, but no differences with regard to online socioemotional or disengagement coping resources. The educational inequalities in online coping are somewhat smaller than educational inequalities in offline coping, leading to remarkable consequences for social policy. Furthermore, we find a relatively complex pattern of interrelations between offline inequality (education) and different types of digital inequality (skills, usage, resources). In our conclusions we make a plea for more research on outcomes of Internet use and we discuss the implications of our findings for further research.

AB Ensuring quality education for all students requires teachers to possess knowledge and skills in utilising digital technologies effectively for teaching and learning. This study explored how pre-service teachers (PSTs) perceive their digital attitude, efficacy, literacy, engagement, and understanding of digital technologies in an online learning environment. The study employed a mixed-methods research approach. A survey comprising Likert Scale questions and demographic information was administered to 110 PSTs from a regional university. Descriptive statistics were employed to investigate the relationship between PSTs' understanding of digital technologies and their attitude, literacy, self-efficacy, and learning engagement in online learning. To illustrate the frequently used words in participants' definitions of digital technologies, a 'word cloud' representation was utilised, accompanied by quantitative weightings of key terms. The study revealed significant connections between PST self-efficacy and their attitudes toward digital technologies, digital literacies, and learner engagement. Notably, most of the PSTs exhibited narrower definitions of digital technologies than anticipated. The implications of these findings for course design are discussed, emphasising the need to address PSTs' perceptions of digital technologies, foster their self-efficacy, and enhance their digital literacy and engagement in online learning environments. Understanding these factors can lead to more effective integration of digital technologies in teacher education program courses, ultimately preparing future teachers for digital-age classrooms.

AB Science, Technology and Society (STS) is one of the learning areas that is stated in the Social Studies Course Curriculum. This learning area is included in all the class levels in which the social studies course is taught with the aim of providing various skills to the students. Even in the STS learning area of the fifth grade, it is stated that digital literacy and self-control are the skills intended to be gained by students. Considering this situation, in addition to the digital literacy and self-control skills, the predictive effects of the STS learning area on the academic achievements of students were investigated in the study. This study, in which the correlational survey method was employed, was carried out with 742 students in the fifth grade. The data were collected with 'The Science, Technology and Society Learning Area Achievement Test', The Digital Literacy Scale', 'The Self-control Scale for Children', and 'The Social Studies Course Motivation Scale'. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis were used in the data analysis. According to the research results, it was found that digital literacy, self-control and course motivation predict the academic achievements of the students in the STS learning area. It was also determined that the predictive effect of these variables on the academic achievement in the STS learning area was in the order of digital literacy, self-control and course motivation. In line with this result, it can be claimed that both skill building and motivation are effective in academic achievement.

AB Social media engagement is part of our society, especially for the younger generation who are keen on technology. Nowadays, social media has become the most used platform to pick up information. Therefore, the increased number of social media users was not followed by the ability to distinguish between fake and authentic information online. There is a reason that drives someone to hold a specific belief since epistemic is a domain-dependent form that exists contextually. This study develops a scale with 33 items to investigate the variables of internet epistemic beliefs, digital literacy, and social media engagements. A total of 512 participants administered the survey using the snowball sampling method. This study generates five CFA analysis factors and concludes a model through an SEM analysis. This study investigated the interrelationship between internet epistemic belief and social media engagement with digital literacy as a mediation role. Findings draw some conclusions and practical implications in preparing the youth to be digitally adaptive and wise.

DE Mathematics; teachers; curriculum transformation; development of digital

AB Teaching mathematics at primary schools in the Czech Republic is on the threshold of radical changes. These changes are the logical consequences of changes in the curriculum of computer-oriented subjects (or computer science subjects - CSs), where they will more than in the past focus on teaching algorithmization, programming, coding and the development of informatics thinking. While it was previously the content of these subjects to educate pupils in areas such as hardware, or the use of application software, according to the new concept these topics will move to other school subjects.
   We believe that mathematics teachers are well prepared for the upcoming planned changes beyond the others, also due to the interconnectedness of both subjects in terms of content and mutual usefulness or usability.
   Many teachers of mathematics have already included activities that support the development of digital literacy in their teaching for a long time, but often in the planning of teaching they are based on what their pupils have learned in CSs lessons.
   We present further results of our research carried out at almost 2000 Czech pupils in primary schools and their mathematics teachers. We deal with the issue of readiness of Czech teachers for planned changes, in what form and to what extent they currently develop digital literacy in mathematics lessons and whether and how their pupils perceive these efforts.

AB This study aims to bridge the gap between extended reality (XR) and digital literacy (DL) in popular science education and further develop a DL-XR framework. XR includes augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR, VR, and MR), which has received increased attention and has been used for educational purposes in recent years. However, the studies of XR in popular science education and its impact on students are scant. It is also challenging to find studies entailing XR and DL in education. This study not only offers an overview of the status quo of XR education but also is the first research presenting a referential framework that systematically integrates the many dimensions of XR and DL for future research and educational practices. XR has been extensively used in museums, benefiting users with immersive, authentic, hands-on, and interactive experiences. In the DL-XR framework, based on the variations of "individual-group" and "passive consumption-active creation", eight dimensions of DL linked to XR are proposed, including "access and understanding", "evaluation", "ethics and well-being", "interaction", "collaboration", "creation", "problem-solving", and "civic engagement and responsibility". In the nurturing of DL, evidence revealed that XR is mostly used for learners to access knowledge/information and interact with virtual items; nonetheless, its applications for active creation, problem-solving, and collaboration are seldom prioritised. This study further proposes integrating project-based learning into XR pedagogical practices, which can maximise its impact on learning and empower the learners to achieve advanced levels of DL.

AB Background: Continual development of the social care workforce is a key element in improving outcomes for the users of social care services. As the delivery of social care services continues to benefit from innovation in assistive technologies, it is important that the digital capabilities of the social care workforce are aligned. Policy makers have highlighted the importance of using technology to support workforce learning and development, and the need to ensure that the workforce has the necessary digital skills to fully benefit from such provisions.
   Objective: This study aims to identify the digital capability of the social care workforce in Northern Ireland and to explore the workforce's appetite for and barriers to using technology for learning and development. This study is designed to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the digital capability of the social care workforce in Northern Ireland? (2) What is the workforce's appetite to participate in digital learning and development? and (3) If there are barriers to the uptake of technology for learning and development, what are these barriers?
   Methods: A survey was created and distributed to the Northern Ireland social care workforce. This survey collected data on 127 metrics that described demographics, basic digital skills, technology confidence and access, factors that influence learning and development, experience with digital learning solutions, and perceived value and challenges of using technology for learning.
   Results: The survey was opened from December 13, 2018, to January 18, 2019. A total of 775 survey respondents completed the survey. The results indicated a workforce with a high level of self-reported basic digital skills and confidence. Face-to-face delivery of learning is still the most common method of accessing learning, which was used by 83.7% (649/775) of the respondents; however, this is closely followed by digital learning, which was used by 79.0% (612/775) of the respondents. There was a negative correlation between age and digital skills (r(s)=-0.262; P<.001), and a positive correlation between technology confidence and digital skills (r(s)=0.482; P<.001). There was also a negative correlation between age and the perceived value of technology (r(s)=-0.088; P=.02). The results indicated a predominantly motivated workforce in which a sizable portion is already engaged in informal digital learning. The results indicated that lower self-reported basic digital skills and confidence were associated with less interest in engaging with e-learning tools and that a portion of the workforce would benefit from additional basic digital skills training.
   Conclusions: These promising results provide a positive outlook for the potential of digital learning and development within the social care workforce. The findings provide clear areas of focus for the future use of technology for learning and development of the social care workforce and considerations to maximize engagement with such approaches.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to identify the mediating effect of learning flow and the moderated mediation effect of digital literacy on the effect of the learning presence of non-face-to-face class experience in nursing students on academic achievement. Methods: Participants were 272 nursing students from six universities in two different cities. A self-report questionnaire was used to measure learning presence, learning flow, digital literacy, and academic achievement. Analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 and SPSS PROCESS Macro (4.0). Results: The mediating effect of learning flow on the effect of learning presence on academic achievement was 0.42, and the moderated mediation index of digital literacy was 0.17. Learning flow showed a mediating effect on the relationship between learning presence and academic achievement. Digital literacy had a moderated mediation effect on the relationship between learning presence and academic achievement that was mediated by learning flow. Conclusion: The intensity of the mediating effect of nursing students' learning presence on academic achievement through learning flow increases as the level of digital literacy increases. These results suggest that educational programs considering the level of learning presence, learning flow, and digital literacy are required to promote the academic achievement of nursing college students.

AB During 2020, the pandemic caused by COVID-19 expanded in Latin America, as a consequence face-to-face teaching experienced an abrupt transition to non-face-to-face environments, some of them supported by technologies, especially by the use of platforms for the management of learning and learning. video conferencing sessions. This forced teachers more than ever to discover and deploy their technological skills, however, this transition brought with it uncertainty about the level of development of teachers' digital skills. This article presents the elaboration and reliability analysis of an instrument called the Digital Competences Questionnaire in Non-Presential Environments (CD-NP), whose objective is to measure in a non-presential teaching environment the perspectives of high school students on skills. shown by their professors to implement the chair mediated by the use of digital tools. In the elaboration and validation of the questionnaire, 19 experts participated, who concluded that the basic digital competences required by teachers to respond to the new reality of teaching are: communicative interaction, the selection and design of digital materials, and the evaluation of learning. 392 students from a private university collaborated to carry out the reliability analysis. The findings show that the instrument has acceptable levels of reliability since various analyzes were carried out, the most representative being that each item and category exceeded a Cronbach's alpha of 0.8093 and a McDonald's Omega coefficient of 0.8958. It is concluded that the instrument has the necessary properties to be applied in the Mexican context, and opens the door to be implemented in other Latin American scenarios.

AB Industry 4.0 requires workers to have ability in new literacy including digital literacy, technology literacy, and human literacy. The objective of this study is the roles of digital literacy, technology literacy, and human literacy to encourage readiness of students to access work world. This research is a quantitative research. The population of this study was 100 students of education study programs, Universitas Negeri Semarang with 80 students as samples calculated by Slovin formula with 5% error rate. The data collection techniques use questionnaires. The data analysis techniques use analysis of multiple regression with SPSS version 21. The results of this study shows that multiple regression analysis obtained equation Y = 6.173 + 0.308X1 + 0.264X2 + 0.230X3 + e. Simultaneously, digital literacy, technology literacy, and human literacy have positive and significant 54.7% influence to the work readiness. Partially, digital literacy affects 14.9%, technology literacy affects 7.9%, and human literacy affects 6.6% to work readiness. Suggestions from this research are university could enhance literacy in the digital, technology, and human fields. For digital literacy, university must make a habit and culture for students to access various information through the internet. For technology literacy, university could introduce and understand the use of the latest technology for students who are relevant to the department and work world. For human literacy, university could require students to join an organization to build spirit of leadership, teamwork, etc., so that they are more motivated and ready to face the work world.

AB In order to develop 21st-century skills, especially with respect to digital technologies, students are supposed to know how to use digital technologies for learning and problem solving. In recent years, approaches to personalized learning have been considered to be particularly promising in this regard. A clearly defined concept of personalized learning is still lacking, however. Rather, it serves an umbrella term for educational approaches that try to do justice to the individual abilities, knowledge and learning needs of each student. Our study deals with theoretical dimensions of this multilayered concept and investigates the in-school use of digital technologies for personalized learning as reported by students in connection with their self-assessed digital skills and beliefs about the usefulness of ICT in learning. For this purpose, we have analyzed data from a survey of N = 860 students (8th grade) from 31 Swiss schools that have introduced personalized learning concepts. A structural equation model shows that increased reported use of digital technologies in learning environments that are characterized by open teaching methods is an important aspect of personalized learning because it has a positive effect on both self-reported digital skills and self-perceived ICT-related beliefs in learning. At the same time, the experienced freedom of choice in learning activities that include digital technologies, which is often considered a crucial dimension of personalized learning, has no significant effect.

AB In the 21st century, ICT-based teaching has evolved into problem-solving (PS). Therefore, scholars from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have identified the factors that facilitate such a process in their classes. Therefore, empirical evidence on English language teaching is warranted to uncover what factors shape teachers' professional competence to have such language classes. Thus, putting one step forward, this explanatory study explored the antecedents shaping language teachers' 21st-century digital competence from a bi-level approach. As a result, 863 Iranian EFL teachers who taught English in various areas responded to instruments measuring their ICT-individual characteristics, schools' ICT characteristics, and 21st-century digital competence. The partial least square structural modeling (PLS-SEM) showed that the teachers' connectivity and computer for instruction (CI) in school improved their competence to analyze, browse, and evaluate language learners' problems with it. Regarding their individual aspects, instructors' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), information access (IA), and perception of the benefits of ICTs were the main antecedents, leading them to become creative problem-solvers. Having examined the findings, the researcher offers teachers to enhance their approaches beyond teaching language skills with ICT to problem-solving. Curriculum experts should also invest more money and equip their schools with ICTs gadgets, increasing instructors' connectivity and creativity.

AB The paper focuses on analyzing the digital skills and adaptability of students in the context of digital transformation based on the results of an online survey of 1.282 students of Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education (HCMUTE). The results show that students' digital skills and adaptability in the context of digital transformation at HCMUTE are demonstrated through aspects such as: HCMUTE's online learning system; document search engines; using digital skills and adaptability; habits are mainly expressed during the study period; Software applications are mainly used for student's learning and adaptability in the context of digital transformation. Applying students' digital skills and adaptability in the digital context also has advantages (the search for information, the development of study plans, the archiving of documents, etc.) and difficulties (insufficient learning facilities, learning space and interaction lead to lower efficiency when compared to traditional learning methods, ...). Therefore, the research results are expected to help provide a more objective view of the reality of digital adoption and students' adaptability in the digital transformation context at HCMUTE.

AB In the last decade, information and communication technologies have made it possible to energize learning environments at different levels of education. However, in the Technical University of Machala, Ecuador, it has been detected that the professionals who graduated from the Basic Education Career have shortcomings related to the incorporation of technologies in the teaching learning process. For this reason, this paper presents the results of research aimed at strengthening teaching skills through the incorporation of technology in Basic Education learning environments. A mixed research approach was used that enabled the collection and analysis of data obtained through the application of theoretical and empirical level methods. In order to analyze the extent to which a digital teacher training course favors skills in the incorporation of technology in the classroom, a LIKERT scale questionnaire, interviews, and field notes were applied. The population consisted of 40 Basic Education teachers who participated in face-to-face classes. The interpretation of the data obtained at the end of the training showed that the participants demonstrated empowerment in the use of technology, recognized the importance of ongoing training to develop these skills and incorporate emerging educational technologies in the teaching-learning process, and offered them security to be able to incorporate technology in their didactic plans and use them properly in their educational work.

AB Background: eHealth literacy (eHL) is considered an important competency among healthcare providers in healthcare systems, especially following the introduction of information and communication technologies. Objectives: This study aimed to identify the relationship and direction of factors affecting nursing students' eHL in an online learning environment. Design: A cross-sectional study. Settings: Three nursing colleges located in Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do in Korea. Participants: Participants were 259 nursing students aged 18???29 years who lived in the Seoul metropolitan area. Methods: Self-reported data on variables including attitudes toward online learning, digital literacy, self-efficacy, and eHL, were collected and analyzed using an independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance. The mediating effects were verified through the bootstrapping method using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results: The results indicated that although attitudes toward online learning affected digital literacy, they did not directly influence eHL. Additionally, digital literacy and self-efficacy were also found to be associated with eHL and mediate the relationship between online learning attitudes and eHL. Conclusions: As online nursing education rapidly becomes commonplace due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes toward online learning, digital literacy, and self-efficacy must be improved to enhance eHL.

DE Digital literacy; International; Students as partners; Curriculum design
AB This case study is based on an externally funded project at a University in the UK. The specific institutional problem addressed is the transition and orientation of international students into a blended learning environment. The project title 'In-STEP'-International Student and Education Partnerships conveys a fundamental aim of developing mutual understanding and synchronicity between the students, staff and collaborative partnerships. There are 3 different contexts for this study the first being a one-year International Foundation Year (IFY) delivered in the UK, secondly teaching in Transnational Education (TNE) settings and finally working with students as creative partners in their learning.
   Evidence from international student focus groups and interviews, indicates that students initially struggle not only with adapting to a new country, but also to unfamiliar pedagogies. This can be compounded by late arrival and missing induction programmes. Our findings are supported by the Higher Education Academy's (HEA) Teaching International Students Project. However, this research also indicates that international students, when comfortable in a digital environment, find the use of technology valuable as they can, for example, use online materials at their own pace, respond online in a 'safe' environment and engage in learning anywhere and at any time.
   As this project has developed students and staff identified issues that include challenging the notion of digital literacy, moving to digital fluency, students bringing their own devices (BYOD), (particularly relevant in TNE settings), digital identity and footprint, netiquette, information authenticity and reliability and information use.
   One of our major sites of enquiry is an existing collaboration between the University and a local tertiary college. We developed a four year integrated undergraduate 'package' which starts with an International Foundation Year (IFY), part-generic and part-subject specific followed by a three year undergraduate degree course. In the IFY course team, the course leader and curriculum content designers were initially from the University, but the modules were taught by the tertiary college. Included in the course is the module "Learning in a digital environment" which aims to help students develop their digital literacy skills. The module concentrates on four main digital capabilities:
   1. Learning skills and life planning
   2. ICT/computer literacy
   3. Information literacy
   4. Communication and collaboration
   The curriculum is designed around a task orientated approach that brings together various components without setting a content syllabus. The content is driven by the students' needs and capabilities. Students were encouraged to feedback on the tasks and suggest changes that fed into the course design. From this course students identified with staff their main areas of concern, these were made into a design brief for a student focused awareness raising initiative. An international student studying photography was then commissioned to produce 5 photo essays on digital identity, cyber bullying, netiquette, information authenticity and reliability and BYOD. The images and video clips explaining how and why the images came about and what they represent are available through posters linked to web sites, accessible by QR codes. These resources will be shared in this presentation and will be available for delegates to access after the conference.

AB This research examines the influence of digital literacy on preschool children's school readiness and mental health. The analysis dissects psychological resilience's role as a mediator among digitally literate-conscious kids. The underlying theory underpinning the literature is a social learning theory, which provides the paradigm lens for effectively accessing and evaluating available digital information. This study measures these proposed assumptions using structural equation modeling techniques. Data collection was carried out in structured questionnaires, and the target population was parents of preschool children. The study used a convenience sampling technique to select a sample of parents based on preschool children under five. The results show that digital literacy among preschoolers is directly and positively related to their school readiness, mental well-being, and resilience. Findings suggest that psychological resilience significantly mediates between children's digital literacy and school readiness. The findings provide valued insight and further directions for policymakers and educators from developing countries. It offers valuable guidance for teachers and parents of preschool children. Findings will encourage them to allow children to use digital gadgets to build and enhance their understanding of digital information. Preschoolers should also receive implicit and explicit training in the practical and fundamental knowledge of digital technologies for their educational use. In theory, this study contributes to the scientific literature by answering how digital literacy and resilience positively impact children's school readiness and mental well-being.

AB Social Networks offer a space for the social and collaborative construction of learning, but this will depend on the use that is made of them. The following dissertation has the purpose of describing the didactic use of Facebook for the digital literacy of a group of students for teachers in a Venezuelan university. The theoretical foundation addresses the educational use of social networks and media and media literacy. Methodologically it is a descriptive research with a qualitative approach and under the modality of a case study that considers a section of new students entering the specialty of Mathematics of the Pedagogical Experimental University Liberator (UPEL) in Maracay-Venezuela. Some preliminary conclusions indicate that there is no correct use of social networks by subjects, but as a result of a training plan they have been able to acquire didactic-technological competences associated with the processing of information in digital contexts.

AB INTRODUCTION. The inclusion of the digital competence in the training curriculums of university students is necessary because of the changes experienced in society due to the digitization of all its fields. Students must acquire the necessary skills and abilities to use the technological resources that allow them to function freely within the digital age. To promote its development, universities implement active methodologies where the student becomes the protagonist of the teaching-learning process. Among these methodological proposals is gamification. METHOD. This work presents the results obtained on the development of the digital teaching competence, taking into account its five dimensions, in the student bodies of the Degree of Social Education (ES) and the Degree of Physical Activity and Sport Science (CAFD), using a gamified project as a methodological strategy. A Quantitative research of a quasi-experimental nature has been carried out with repeated pretest-postest measures without a control group. The sample consists of 86 students (48 ES and 38 CAFD). 44.9% are men and 55.1% are women and the participants belong to the age groups that range from 18 to 25. RESULTS. The results show that, after intervention through the implementation of gamification, all values in the five dimensions of the digital teaching competence (digital literacy, communication, collaboration, content creation, security and problem solving) increase considerably. DISCUSSION. The study concludes that when the development of the digital skills are promoted through active learning strategies such as gamification, the results are favorable in all its items, regardless of the sex or the degree studied.

AB The article focuses on analyzing the factors affecting students' digital skills and adaptability in the context of digital transformation. The study identified influencing factors: Environment, Behavior, Individuals, Teachers, Time of use, and access. However, the results of an online survey of 1.282 students of the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education (HCMUTE) with Cronbach's Alpha test method, EFA analysis, correlations, and regression analysis, showed that there are 3/5 factors identified in the hypothesis that affect digital skills and adaptability of HCMUTE students in the context of digital transformation, specifically: behavior (Beta = 0.177, Sig. = 0.000); individuals (Beta = 0.181, Sig. = 0.027); teacher (Beta = 0.547, Sig. = 0.000). Besides, the environment does not affect digital skills and adaptability (KNSKNTU) due to Beta = 0.017 and Sig.=0.384>0.05. Sig does not involve usage and access time factors. >0.05 in the table Correlations not be further analyzed in the regression model. The research results are expected to help provide a more objective view of the reality of digital adoption and student adaptability in the digital transformation context at HCMUTE.

AB The Institute of Coding (IoC) is a new (SIC)40m+ initiative by the UK Government to "transform the digital skills profile of the country". In the context of widespread national and international educational and economic policy interventions, it responds to the apparently contradictory data that the United Kingdom (UK) has a digital skills shortage across a variety of sectors, yet its higher education system produces computing graduates every year who end up unemployed, or underemployed.
   The Institute is a large-scale national intervention to address some of the perceived issues with formal educational routes versus industry-focused skills and training, for example: technical skills versus "soft" or "work-ready" skills; industry-readiness versus "deep education"; inclusion and diversity of the current and future technical workforce; and managing expectations for the broad digital, data and computational skills demands of employers across a wide range of economic sectors. Alongside these activities at the higher education-industry interface, we have also seen substantial computer science curriculum reform across the four nations of the UK.
   In this paper, we outline the background, evidence base and rationale for the IoC (especially within the complex UK policy context); its key themes, current activities and outputs; as well as anticipate its likely impact over the coming years. Furthermore, we reflect on the potential replicability of aspects of the Institute (and related initiatives in the UK) to other nations or regions with similar ambitions to address the "digital skills crisis".

AB The digital skills divide has been raised as a serious issue during the COVID-19. However, few studies explored the predictive influence of personality traits on college students' digital skills in online learning. To address this gap, this study took the second-level digital divide as the focus to conduct a two-round survey of college students over nearly 2 years based on cross-sectional and longitudinal methods to explore whether there is a digital skill divide or personality trait differences between urban and rural college students while learning online, and whether college students' personality traits can predict their digital skills. The results confirmed the rural and urban college students' digital skills divide. There were significant differences in all dimensions of their digital skills except for mobile skills. In addition, the digital skills divide of these college students persisted for nearly 2 years. Specifically, this study further confirmed that there were significant differences in the urban and rural college students' extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness, but there was no significant difference in their openness and conscientiousness. Additionally, there was no change in the urban and rural college students' personality trait differences in nearly 2 years. Personality traits could positively predict college students' digital skills. This study provides evidence for bridging the second-level digital divide of the rural and urban college students from the perspective of personality traits.
